Evaluation of litigations included in contingent liabilities,
Key Audit Matter,How our audit addressed the key audit matter
"The Bank has material open tax litigations which involve significant judgement to determine the possible outcome of these disputes. Significant management judgement is needed in determining whether an obligation exists and whether a provision should be recognised as at the reporting date, in accordance with the accounting criteria set under Accounting Standard 29 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets ('AS 29'), or whether it needs to be disclosed as a contingent liability. Further significant judgements are also involved in measuring such obligations, the most significant of which are: . Assessment of liability: Judgement is involved in the determination of whether an outflow in respect of identified material matters are probable and can be estimated reliably;","Our Audit procedures with respect to this matter included: Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the Bank's key controls over the estimation, monitoring and disclosure of provisions and contingent liabilities."
