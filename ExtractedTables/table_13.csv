Acute physical,"Acute physical hazards can have a negative influence on our credit portfolio by causing bad debts due to damage to property, infrastructure, and land. This is also relevant for climate disasters destroying assets (that serve as collaterals). We continue to measure physical risks from a climate risk assessment perspective and will assess the priority of these risks in the near-to-medium term. In addition, our Disaster Response and Business Continuity teams conduct business impact analyses and have rapid response procedures in place in the event of natural disasters such as floods."
Chronic physical,"Chronic physical risks are far into the future. Given that climate risk is an emerging and long-term risk us, we will consider adopting a suitable methodology/pathway to analyse our exposures under different climate scenarios."
