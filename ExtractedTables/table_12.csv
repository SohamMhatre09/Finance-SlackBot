Current regulation æ±½,"Banks are highly regulated in the country and mandates as part of current regulations are always integrated into the overall risk planning and assessment process. Current regulations are also factored in the credit assessment process, especially through the SEMS framework which is used to screen large loans for environmental and social risks."
Emerging regulation,"Transition risk can impact the Bank's credit portfolio resulting from changes in the climate policy, technology, consumer, and market sentiment during the transition to a low-carbon economy. This is particularly relevant for policy changes that can result in loan defaults from certain sectors like coal, thermal and infrastructure. We are exploring techniques for developing climate risk assessment and scenario analysis to analyse our portfolio at risk due to the transition risk of climate change."
Technology,"While our digital environment and information security standards are the foundation of our business today, as financial services professionals, we do not anticipate technology to have a significant impact on climate risk. Our low-carbon digital banking products use technology to enable business."
Legal,"For large loans, we verify whether the project complies with all applicable environmental rules, failing to do so could result in the loan becoming a non-performing asset if the project goes into litigation. This, however, is not a claim against the Bank. There are no other circumstances in which the Bank can be held liable for a climate-related lawsuit."
Market,"In the context of climate change, markets could play a key role in shifting the demand and supply for certain products like green loans or bonds, or in low-carbon digital products. However, we do recognise the relevance of change in consumer preferences, and hence, the need to evaluate this risk, but do not have the tools at present to quantify/include this as part of our risk assessment process."
Reputation,"Reputation risk from community/customer perception is a primary risk to our business. We thus invest in community and customer involvement through surveys to educate and enlighten them on our environmental sustainability programmes. Further, ESG performance measures are increasingly being used by the global investor community, especially sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, to assess long-term profitable growth. We strive to implement environment-friendly measures throughout our operations. We further show our commitment to ESG, particularly climate change, by including ESG elements in regulatory reporting such as the annual report. In addition, in our annual integrated report, we publish details on our carbon emissions and footprint (third-party assured)."
