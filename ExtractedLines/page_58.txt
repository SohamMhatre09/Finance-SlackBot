GHG emissions and climate change
At HDFC Bank, we have put in place an integrated strategy
for managing our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions (refer
page 69 and 70). As we had surpassed our previously set
targets, we have taken on new targets with FY22 as base
year. Our emission sources included in our base year GHG
inventory demonstrates an enhancement of our ambitions
and transparency goals. Not only have we ensured the
completeness of our Scope 2 emissions from already
identified source categories, but also included our co-
located data centres as a source category for our scope 2
emissions. Similarly, we have added a new source category
for our Scope 3 emissions - emissions on account of
electricity consumption at our other facilities.
