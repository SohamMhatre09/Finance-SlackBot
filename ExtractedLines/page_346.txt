Amortisation of expenditure on account of enhancement in family pension of employees of banks
The Reserve Bank of India, vide its notification dated October 04, 2021 granted Banks an option to amortise the expenditure
on account of enhancement of family pension, over a period not exceeding five years beginning with the financial year ending
March 31, 2022, subject to a minimum of one-fifth of the total amount involved being expensed every year. The Bank has not
availed the said option and has recognised the entire expenditure on account of enhancement of family pension in financial
year ended March 31, 2022.
Provident fund
The guidance note on AS-15, Employee Benefits, states that employer established provident funds, where interest is guaranteed
are to be considered as defined benefit plans and the liability has to be valued. The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) has issued
a guidance note on valuation of interest rate guarantees on exempt provident funds. The actuary has accordingly valued the
same and the Bank held a provision of Nil as at March 31, 2022 (previous year: Nil), towards the present value of the guaranteed
interest benefit obligation. The actuary has followed the deterministic approach as prescribed by the guidance note.
