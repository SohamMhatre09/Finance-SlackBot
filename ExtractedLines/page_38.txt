Strategy in Action
Commercial & Rural Banking
Commercial and Rural Banking
(CRB) primarily caters to entities in
manufacturing, exports, employment,
retail and trade, supply chain network
and infrastructure. CRB lending
constitutes a large part of our PSL
lending book. CRB serves Micro, Small
and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs),
emerging corporates, commercial
agriculture, farmer finance, healthcare
finance, equipment finance and
commercial transport companies.
We are committed to helping resolve
the challenges faced by this market
segment, like lack of easy or timely
access to credit, high cost of credit
and collateral constraints.
This group enables acquisition of
customer at an early stage. For
instance today's SME and MSME
will transition to tomorrow's mid-
corporates and large corporates. The
Bank aims to support the journeys
of these companies as they mature
through the lifecycle.
The rise of the digitally-enabled
customers presents a unique
opportunity to scale business
and increase wallet share through
augmented end-to-end digital journeys
and increasingly personalised offerings
and services. With products and
platforms such as the SME portal,
the Bank caters to the needs of
the new-age customer. The Bank
intends to grow its agriculture and
allied book by diversifying its portfolio
from staple crops to agri allied and
high value horticulture crops. It also
plans to augment as well as facilitate
the growth of individual ecosystems
that exist within the group, (such
as the rural ecosystem, healthcare
ecosystem, transportation ecosystem
or the supply chain network) with
products and services tailored to
add value and financial strength.
The market potential in the segment
that the CRB group caters to is
immense and the Bank is well-poised
to capitalise on this opportunity
by leveraging its reach, innovation
capabilities, digital prowess and
ecosystem offerings.
