Customer satisfaction
The Customer Service Committee
of the Board (CSCB) works towards
continuously improving the quality of
services rendered to the customer.
It also ensures the implementation
of directives received from the RBI in
this regard. Accordingly, the CSCB
formulates the Bank's comprehensive
deposit policy, incorporating the issues
arising out of the product approval
process, annual survey of depositor
satisfaction, and the triennial audit
of such services, among others. We
ensure strict adherence to market
conduct regulations and have defined
frameworks in place to maintain
transparency in communications to our
customers and clients. During FY22,
we did not record any new cases of
non-compliance concerning product
and service information and labelling,
or marketing communications.
During the year, we undertook several
initiatives to strengthen our IT systems,
augment capabilities and increase
resiliency. To read more about our
initiatives, refer Pg. 78 (Digitisation).
During FY22, we received no
complaints regarding identified leaks,
thefts, or losses of customer data
with respect to data security. During
the same period, we received 298
complaints from customers concerning
breaches of customer privacy, 1
complaint from an outside party
and 19 from regulatory bodies. The
major areas of customer complaints
in FY22 were related to unauthorised
transactions done through UPI,
unauthorised usage through Credit
Card, unauthorised transactions done
through NetBanking, unauthorised
usage through Debit Card online and
failed transactions at the Bank's ATMs.
We have a transparent Grievance
Redressal Mechanism that ensures
quick and effective resolution of
complaints. Customers can reach
out to us through multiple channels
including retail branches, phone
banking application, website and
net banking application and retail
asset customer service centres. Any
grievance received, either verbally,
by email or in writing, if not resolved
and responded to on the same day,
is logged into CRMnext - a state-
of-the-art web-based system or
Vision Plus (for Credit Card related
issues). The CRMnext system has the
capability to record and categorise
grievances into different types and
maintain turnaround times (TAT) for
specific category/sub-category. It also
has an auto escalation mechanism
for cases not resolved within the
defined TAT. This not only ensures
proper recording and resolution of
cases, but also provides for effective
escalation channels in case of delays
in resolution. Acknowledgement is
provided for every grievance logged,
in the form of a Complaint Reference
Number (CRN), and the customer is
kept informed in case of any delay
envisaged by the Bank, in resolution
of the grievance beyond the stated
timelines.
Apart from direct grievances from
customers, grievances received
through various regulatory bodies
including Reserve Bank of India and
Banking Ombudsman are handled
by designated Nodal Officers. The
Bank has also appointed an Internal
Ombudsman as per the guidelines
prescribed by the Reserve Bank of
India. Denial/partial denial cases are
referred to the Internal Ombudsman for
guidance. The decision of the Internal
Ombudsman is binding on the Bank.
ESG governance
ESG matters are a vital component in
the Bank's governance framework. The
CSR and ESG Committee of the Board
oversees the Bank's sustainability
and climate change initiatives. The
Board level committee is guided by
the ESG apex committee. The ESG
apex committee that comprises of
key representatives from the senior
management, oversees sustainability
reporting initiatives, climate change
disclosures, internal projects to ensure
reduction of our overall emissions and
tracks its progress on ESG, to achieve
industry leadership. This Committee is
further supported by ESG action sub-
committees which includes Product
Responsibility Sub-committee, which
looks at ESG risks (including climate
risks) in the existing portfolio and ESG-
linked opportunities; the Environment
Sub-committee which oversees
the environmental impact from our
operations and Social and Governance
Sub-committee which works on
workplace policies and governance
initiatives.
