banking services for large corporates,
mimicking retail experiences. We are
leveraging advanced AI and deep
analytics to simplify investments for
our wealth customers. We contribute
to the Digital Bharat growth story
with a local touch through assisted
journeys, multilingual capabilities, and
deep digital distribution points. The
objective is not just to develop new
products but to innovate rapidly and at
scale, so as to serve the entire gamut
of our 7.1 Crore strong customer base.
In order to achieve this, we also forge
strategic partnerships with new-age
fintech players to offer plug and play
solutions.
Powering these initiatives is our strong
technological backbone. We have
fortified our infrastructure security and
resilience through scalable, state-of-
the-art data centers, AI/ML based
security and monitoring systems and
deep automation in DR resiliency. We
are also strengthening the foundation
by re-architecting the core technology.
We are 'hollowing out the core' by
moving away from legacy systems into
a cloud native, agile system, and a
neo-technology stack.
Our people are the most important
enablers as we transform into a
future-ready, digital-first bank. We
are refreshing our people practices
adapting to new ways of working. Our
hiring strategies leverage Gen X to Gen
Z talent offering diverse skillsets to
build in-house deep-tech capabilities.
Our focus is on fostering a culture of
innovation, agility and growth.
The Bank has lined up exciting
launches in the coming quarters
with offerings that not only make
banking simpler but also augment
the experience through value added
services. Our MobileBanking app is
undergoing a massive re-write with a
refreshed UI/UX focusing on journey
simplification for the customer. The
end goal is simple, customer delight
across all segments on the back of a
resilient infrastructure and seamless
digital experiences.
