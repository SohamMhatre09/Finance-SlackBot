conduct of its business, including adherence to Bank's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds
and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information,
as required under the Act.
Auditor's Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed
to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether internal financial controls with reference to financial statements was established and maintained and if
such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with
reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial

risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the
Bank's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.
