External Environment
Key external drivers and
our response
Just as the global economy prepared to
leave behind the pangs of the pandemic
(despite uncertainties associated with
subsequent waves and rising inflationary
pressures), the Russia-Ukraine conflict
escalated. The consequent imposition
of sanctions on Russia kept the global
economy and financial system on
tenterhooks. Further, China's slowdown,
Sri Lanka's crisis and other geopolitical
issues continue to weigh on the economic
recovery, clouding India's near-term
growth outlook as well.
The Indian banking sector, supported by regulatory and
Government interventions, has remained resilient and
sufficiently capitalised. Measures such as moratorium on
payment of loan instalments and restructuring of loans,
among others, alleviated the stress while helping banks
to continue lending to productive sectors. The pandemic
has accelerated the technology-led transformation in the
financial services space, with new customised products and
services being delivered using digital technologies. However,
it has also elevated the risks related to data privacy and
cyber security which need to be mitigated on an ongoing
basis.
