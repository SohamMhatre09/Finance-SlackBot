Financial Literacy and Inclusion
The first step towards true financial
inclusion is financial literacy. Financial
literacy camps are periodically
conducted at our branches. In
addition, we have set up financial
literacy centres across India. We
are also working with our non-profit
partners to enhance financial literacy.
The camps are designed to provide
communities with information about
the fundamentals of saving, investing
and organised finance, enabling them
to make informed decisions. Digidhan,
our flagship plan under this pillar, is a
mobile financial literacy programme
that travels the length and breadth of
the country's hinterland, presenting
the advantages of digital banking in an
audio-visual format.
