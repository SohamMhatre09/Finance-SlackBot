7. Accounting for employee share based payments
The shareholders of the Bank approved the grant of equity share options under Plan "C" in June 2005, Plan "D" in June 2007,
Plan "E" in June 2010, Plan "F" in June 2013 and Plan "G" in July 2016. Under the terms of each of these Plans, the Bank may
issue to its employees and Whole Time Directors, Equity Stock Options ('ESOPs') each of which is convertible into one equity
share. All the plans were framed in accordance with the SEBI (Employee Stock Option Scheme & Employee Stock Purchase
Scheme) Guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and as applicable at the time of the grant. The accounting for the
stock options has been in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefits and
Sweaty Equity) Regulations, 2021 and RBI guidelines to the extent applicable.
Plans C, D, E, F and G provide for the issuance of options at the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration
Committee of the Board ('NRC') at the closing price on the working day immediately preceding the date when options are
granted. This closing price is the closing price of the Bank's equity share on an Indian stock exchange with the highest trading
volume as of the working day preceding the date of grant.
The vesting conditions applicable to the options are at the discretion of the NRC. These options are exercisable on vesting,
for a period as set forth by the NRC at the time of the grant. The period in which the options may be exercised cannot exceed
five years from date of expiry of vesting period. During the financial year 2021-22, certain modifications were made in the
subsisting ESOP Plans pursuant to the approval of the shareholders of the Bank as to allow any employee of the Bank moving
/ getting transferred to a subsidiary company, to be so entitled to the stock options already granted to such an employee as
continuity of service for Long Term Incentives earned during the course of his / her service with the Bank.
