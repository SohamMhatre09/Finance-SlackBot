Fighting the pandemic
India
TANK
We reached out to
Covid-care hospitals in
several states to learn
about their needs and
concerns, with the aim to fix
infrastructural gaps using
the lessons learned during
the second and third wave.
Through the Covid Crisis
Support Scholarship
Programme, we are assisting
4,000+ students who are
experiencing personal or
financial hardships, as
a result of Covid. With
monetary aid up to ₹75,000,
the Bank created a specific
initiative to help students
from class 1 and above, up
to those pursuing UG and PG
programmes.
We are increasing the oxygen
capacity in 18 hospitals
around the country to better
prepare for the approaching
COVID-19 waves. These
oxygen plants are now being
set up in Uttar Pradesh,
Jharkhand, Haryana, Punjab,
Karnataka, Kerala, Assam,
West Bengal, New Delhi,
Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh,
Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu,
Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and
Himanchal Pradesh.

apparel-related job areas.
This included awareness/
counseling sessions, quality
training sessions, provision
of learning materials, toolkit

We aim to place women
candidates in top national
and international companies.
We are setting up a team
to follow and support the
applicants, once they've been
placed through off-site or on-
site verification.
With our 'Head Held High'
(HHH) initiative, we have
developed the 'Make India
Capable' programme
which aim to improve the
skills and capabilities of
1500 rural youths in ten
districts across ten states
(Karnataka, Maharashtra,
Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Bihar,
Uttarakhand, Telangana,
Gujarat, Haryana, and Odisha).
The programme guarantees
that ~70% of the trained
youngsters would be placed
in a job within 39 months. The
project commenced in FY21-
22 and has trained over 280
applicants until March 2022.
