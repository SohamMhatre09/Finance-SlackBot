Nation Building
platform provides a large range of
offers that help customers reduce their
expenses on healthcare and wellness.
The Bank has alliances with 150+
providers including players in
diagnostic, pharmaceutical and
hospital care. Attractive membership
benefit programmes are provided to
customers as a value-added service
across segments.
Two special programmes, providing
customised banking and financial
services benefits have also been
created especially for doctors.
Digitisation and modernisation
of citizen services
The Bank continued its participation
in the digitisation and modernisation
of Government to Citizen (G2C)
services. This has not only helped
optimise resources in Government
organisations but also helped
deliver services remotely. It includes
services like payment of taxes, online
collections of charges and fees by
transport authorities as well as online
tracking of case status with legal
authorities like Motor Accident Claim
Tribunals (MACT). This has also helped
the authorities deliver un-interrupted
services during the pandemic.
Taking banking to the
unbanked
The Bank continued to leverage
Common Service Centres (CSCs)
to reach the last mile. The Bank
expanded its product range in the
last year to include all liability, assets
and payments products. We also
initiated the delivery of Government
sponsored social security schemes
and enabled Business Correspondents
to assist in collection of delinquent
EMIs. Managed by Village Level
Entrepreneurs (VLEs), the CSCs
are instrumental in increasing our
penetration in deeper geographies.
