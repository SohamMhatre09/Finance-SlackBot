Environment
We have been monitoring our energy
performance by benchmarking it
against the Bank's income and
full-time employees (FTEs). During
FY22, our Scope 1+2 GHG emissions
intensity decreased by 14% and
6% y-o-y for per FTE and per Crore
income, respectively.
Key measures to reduce
GHG emissions across our
value chain
Reducing paper waste emissions:
Our digital strategy forms the
backbone of our paper waste
reduction initiatives. Our digital
products and services, along with
automation of several internal as well
as customer-linked processes and
channels, have enabled us to reduce
paper waste generation. The 'Green
Event Guidelines' rolled out by our
retail marketing team has helped save
about 2.14 Million square feet of paper
during the reporting year. We have
also shifted to electronic payments for
our electricity bill payments - which
helps avoid paper use for issuing
about 50,000 Demand Drafts annually.
Where paper use is unavoidable, we
are switching to recycled paper. As a
result, associated emissions increased
by less than 2% y-o-y in FY22, despite
an 18.3% increase in our customer
base.
Tree plantation: We are also
implementing an ambitious tree
plantation programme, under which we
have planted over 17 Lakh trees so far.
This programme has not only positively
impacted our GHG emissions, but has
also helped enhance our social capital
and relationship capital.
Energy efficiency and
energy management
over 80% of our GHG emissions are
attributed to energy consumption
in the form of electricity and diesel
consumption in DG sets. We are
aggressively working to reduce our
energy consumption across operations
to complement our initiatives to
decarbonise. This is being achieved by
reducing energy consumption across
our operations by regulating existing
equipment, installing energy-efficient
ones, and implementing automated
energy management solutions, among
others. Our energy management and
energy efficiency strategy includes
various initiatives.
Energy efficient space cooling
measures: We have installed 55
Air Handling Units (AHUs) at our
Kanjurmarg location and we are
planning to replace all blowers to
EC Fan by FY23, indicating potential
savings of 25-40%. Thus far, we have
converted one AHU as a trial and
saved around 4,082 kWh of electrical
energy while avoiding 4 MT of carbon
emissions. We are installing inverter
ACs in our locations that has helped
us save 5 Million+ kWh of electricity
during FY22. Additionally, we have also
saved 54,450 kWh of electricity during
the year, through installation of VRF
HVAC Unit at our back offices. We use
digital systems and data analytics to
understand the energy consumption
pattern, in addition to ensuring that the
branches are maintained at optimal
temperatures, improving the power
factor and automating major energy
consuming assets.
Efficient data centres: Our Bangalore
data centre, 'Netmagic-DC3B' is a
certified green data centre under
the IGBC Green Data Center Rating
System. We have implemented
several other energy-saving measures
including upgradation to efficient
