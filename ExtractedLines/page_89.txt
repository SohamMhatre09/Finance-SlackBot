WELLNESS MATTERS
Our wellness initiatives are aimed to
help keep our employees and their
families healthy and safe in a year
that saw an unprecedented test of
human resilience. We also introduced
a comprehensive 'Compassion
Package' with an aim to reduce
financial burden on surviving family
members in case of the unfortunate
event of the demise of an employee.
The key features include offer of
employment to a family member and
financial support for education of 2
children till graduation, upto â‚¹10 Lakh.
Other initiatives include providing
additional leave, reimbursement
of treatment expenses, on-call
counselling support, e-consultation
with doctors and awareness drives
through various channels. Further,
the Bank has an Employee Welfare
Trust which cover expenses beyond
Mediclaim on a case-to-case basis.
We also conduct regular health check-
ups and mental health awareness
sessions to address issues arising from
a sedentary lifestyle and stress. All
our employees are provided medical
cover. For our women employees on
the path to embracing motherhood, we
have a comprehensive maternity care
programme.
Further, as a part of our credit policy,
we evaluate all large industrial/
infrastructure projects for potential
adverse social impact, such as
land acquisition, resettlement and
rehabilitation, livelihood losses and
compensation for the same, and also
for exploitative labour or child labour
practices. We strictly prohibit child
labour, forced or compulsory labour in
all forms in our operations. In addition,
through our ESG policy framework, we
strive to ensure that our vendors and
suppliers abide by the labour laws and
human rights - including prohibition
of child labour, forced labour and
trafficked labour. In FY22, we received
no complaints on infringement of
human rights, cases of child labour,
forced labour, and involuntary labour.
The facility attendants deployed at our
