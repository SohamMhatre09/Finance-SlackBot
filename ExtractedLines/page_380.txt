Commodity Price Risks and Foreign Exchange
Risks and Hedging activities
Being in the business of banking, as per the extant regulations,
the Bank does not deal in any commodity, though, it can be
exposed to the commodity price risks in its capacity as lender /
banker to its customers. Currently, the Bank has open exposure
in Precious Metals i.e, Gold / Silver and such open exposures in
Gold / Silver are primarily on account of positions created from
short term deposits under the Gold Monetisation Scheme (GMS)
raised from Customers and trading positions in Gold / Silver.
These positions are managed similar to other foreign exchange
exposures using spot, outright forwards and swap transactions
in Gold/Silver and monitored as part of the trading portfolio within
the stipulated trading risk limits viz. Net overnight open position
limit, Intraday open position limit, Value-at-Risk limit, Stop Loss
Trigger Level etc. that are defined in the Treasury Limits Package.
In addition, Bank is authorized by Reserve Bank of India to
import gold and silver and the exposure arising out of import
of gold and silver on consignment basis is covered on back to
back basis. The spot, forward and swap contracts, outstanding
as on the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are revalued
at the closing spot and forward rates respectively as notified by
FEDAI (Foreign Exchange Dealers' Association of India) and at
interpolated rates for contracts of interim maturities. The USD/
INR rate for valuation of contracts having longer maturities i.e.
greater than one (1) year is implied from the applicable INR and
USD swap curves. For other pairs, where the rates / tenors
are not published by FEDAI, the spot and forward points are
obtained from Refinitiv or Bloomberg for valuation of the foreign
exchange deals. The foreign exchange profit or loss is arrived on
present value basis thereafter, as directed by FEDAI, whereby the
forward profits or losses on the deals, as computed above, are
discounted till the valuation date using the applicable discounting
yields. The resulting profit or loss on valuation is recognized in
the Statement of Profit and Loss.
Given below are the exposure details of the Bank under the Gold
Monetisation Scheme deposits as of March 31, 2022.
