Introduction to
HDFC Bank
Overview
Long-term financing proposals for
large industrial/infrastructure projects
(greater than â‚¹100 Million and tenor
above 5 years) are evaluated through
the SEMS framework, which requires
an assessment of Environmental,
Health, Social, and Safety risks in
addition to other risks as part of
the overall credit appraisal process.
This comprehensive assessment
involves evaluating the borrower's
operations, as well as any potential
negative environmental and social
consequences. We have already
mapped potential impact categories
for risk evaluation of specific, capital-
intensive industries such as roads
and highways, thermal power, power
transmission, cement, hydroelectric
power, and manufacturing, among
others, to guide the assessment
process. In addition, the SEMS
framework includes assessment of
aspects related to labour availability
and worker welfare, risk assessments,
and compliances and approvals.
In FY22, 861 loan proposals were
screened through the SEMS
framework.
