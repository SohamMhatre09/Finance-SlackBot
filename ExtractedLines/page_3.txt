Leading
Responsibly
Leadership is as much about responsibility
as it is about scale and size. It goes much
beyond offering world-class banking
products and services and is also about
creating value for all our stakeholders. This
means we are embedding ESG aspects
into our business strategy. As a domestic
systemically important bank, we feel this
responsibility even more.
We have pledged to become carbon neutral by
FY32. Lending decisions are being increasingly
put through the Environmental, Social and
Governance (ESG) lens and greater emphasis is
being laid on green financing solutions.
At the same time, we are undertaking focused
interventions that are making meaningful
contributions to global sustainable development
goals around reducing poverty, achieving zero
hunger, providing clean water and sanitation,
quality education, and building sustainable
communities.
Leveraging our unmatched physical network and
robust digital capabilities, we are expanding our
stakeholder universe where the real and virtual
worlds converge seamlessly, and more people
are brought into the economic mainstream. The
unprecedented challenges of the past two years
notwithstanding, we have made steady progress
on our sustainability targets.
We believe in leading by example. Responsibility,
thus, begins with us. We are deploying technology
as a force multiplier and anchoring all our actions
to the highest possible standards of Corporate
Governance. Together with our stakeholders, we
are building the bank of the future that can stand
the test of time.
