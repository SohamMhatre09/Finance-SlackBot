Renewable energy
With the goal of gradually
decarbonising our energy
consumption, we are steadily
increasing the share of renewable
energy in our overall power
consumption. We have installed
rooftop solar plants at our offices in
Jaipur, Pune, Noida, Bhubaneswar,
Chandigarh, Mumbai and Mohali.
In Maharashra, we are gradually
shifting our branches to run on green
power procured through DISCOMs at
a premium. So far, 14 of our branches
are operating on green power, resulting
in annual avoidance of ~905 MT
carbon emissions on 1,028 MWh of
procurement per annum.

Managing waste
We are working progressively towards
sustainable management of waste
generated from our operations. We
deal with three types of non-hazardous
waste - e-waste, dry waste (paper
waste) and wet waste (cafeteria,
sewage), of which e-waste is disposed
through authorised recyclers. A total of
212 tonnes of e-waste was generated
in FY22, because of asset refresh,
damaged and non-functional assets.
For paper waste and wet waste, we
are developing a management plan
in consultation with our partners. We
have already initiated pilots at select
locations and intend to scale it up
over the next few years. We continue
to work towards establishing and
implementing systems and procedures
for tracking wet and dry waste from
our operations.
We are also aggressively working
towards minimising the use of plastic
bottles. Single use plastic bottles
have already been phased out from
all our hub offices pan-India, and we
have replaced multiple use plastic
water bottles with glass jars across
all meeting and video conferencing
rooms. Hazardous waste within our
scope, arising from diesel/fuel oil used
in generator sets, is negligible.
Responsible financing
ESG and climate change are
becoming increasingly important from
the perspective of borrower credit
evaluation, as well as regulators and
other stakeholders. We are following
a two-pronged approach to address
ESG and climate change risks in
our lending portfolio. On one hand,
we seek to ensure adoption of and
adherence to complete ESG and
Climate Change assessment across
multiple business divisions when
issuing credit facilities, based on
interactions with stakeholders, external
agencies and relevant literature. On
the other hand, we are engaging
with some of our largest corporate
borrowers to better understand their
ESG strategies and transition plans for
managing climate risks.
Our credit policy requires that no
funding be provided for establishing
new manufacturing units that
produce or consume ozone-depleting
substances, and that no financing
be provided to small- and medium-
sized businesses that manufacture
aerosols containing CFCs. Besides,
as a standard practice, we require all
loans, including project loans, to be
approved by a Credit Approver/Senior
Credit Approver with the necessary
approval authority. Due to the elevated
risk involved with large project loans,
the extension of financing for such
projects require additional approvals
from senior management/the Board
to ensure adequate scrutiny of the
proposals.
Evaluation of environmental and social
risk is an integral part of our overall
credit appraisal and approval process.
