Stories of Parivartan
Increasing production with high-tech farming
Tehsil: Lalsot, Dausa District, Rajasthan
Beneficiary: Prem Devi
Prem Devi is a small-scale
farmer who was dealing
with a variety of challenges,
including poor tomato quality
owing to inappropriate
sapling planting, output
losses due to numerous
illnesses, and severe lack
of water.
We assisted her with a high-
tech farming system and
capacitated her to maximise
profit, while lowering the cost
of production. Drip systems,
mulching sheet covering,
stands, and water tanks
were provided as part of the
initiative to her boost her
agricultural operations.
Since implementation of the
intervention, the water usage
has been reduced due to
installation of drip systems.
Prem Devi sold roughly 150
quintals of tomatoes, making
a profit of ₹98,000. This has
not only improved her quality
of life, but has also motivated
other farmers in the region.
Strengthening agri-horticulture
District: Mandi, Himachal Pradesh
Beneficiary: 2,000 Farmers
Farmers in the Mandi district
have become victims to
exploitation by middlemen.
In addition, their lack of
negotiating power over prices
has aggravated the situation.
We supported market
linkages through:
· Formation of 45 Farmer
Interest Groups (FIG)
· Conducted 25 orientation
trainings on value chain
and value addition in apple
production
· Encouraged farmers to sell
their harvest in bulk
Constructed a model apple
processing machine to
promote apple bi-products
Farmers now have better
market access, with 27.63
tonnes of apples sold
straight from the producer.
FIG farmers have begun
selling their products in bulk
and delivering it straight to
customers. As a result, their
negotiating strength and
revenues have improved.
