Directors' Report
7) Internal Controls, Audit and Compliance
Your Bank has put in place extensive internal controls and
processes to mitigate Operational Risks, including centralised
operations and 'segregation of duty' between the front office
and back office. The front-office units usually act as customer
touch-points and sales and service outlets while the back-office
carries out the entire processing, accounting and settlement
of transactions in the Bank's core banking system. The policy
framework, definition and monitoring of limits is carried out by
various mid-office and risk management functions. The credit
sanctioning and debt management units are also segregated
and do not have any sales and operations responsibilities.
Your Bank has set up various executive-level committees, with
participation from various business and control functions, that
are designed to review and oversee matters pertaining to capital,
assets and liabilities, business practices and customer service,
Operational Risk, information security, business continuity
planning and internal risk-based supervision among others. The
second line of defense functions set standards and lay down
policies and procedures by which the business functions manage
risks, including compliance with applicable laws, compliance
with regulatory guidelines, adherence to operational controls and
relevant standards of conduct. At the ground level, your Bank has
a mix of preventive and detective controls implemented through
systems and processes, ensuring a robust framework in your
Bank to enable correct and complete accounting, identification
of outliers (if any) by the Management on a timely basis for
corrective action and mitigating Operational Risks.

Your Bank has an Internal Audit Department which is responsible
for independently evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of
all internal controls, risk management, governance systems and
processes and is manned by appropriately qualified personnel.

out audits across various businesses i.e. Retail, Wholesale and
Treasury (for India and Overseas books), audit of Operations units,
Management and Thematic audits, Information Security audit,
Revenue audit and Concurrent audit in order to independently
evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls on
an ongoing basis and pro-actively recommending enhancements
thereof. The Internal Audit Department, during the course of audit,
also ascertains the extent of adherence to regulatory guidelines,
legal requirements and operational processes and provides
timely feedback to the Management for corrective actions. A
strong oversight on the operations is also kept through off-site
monitoring by use of data analytics to study trends/patterns to
detect outliers (if any) and alert the Management.
The Internal Audit Department also independently reviews
your Bank's implementation of Internal Rating Based (IRB)-
approach for calculation of capital charge for Credit Risk, the
appropriateness of your Bank's ICAAP, as well as evaluates the
