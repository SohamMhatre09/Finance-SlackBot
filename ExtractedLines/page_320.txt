Fixed assets and depreciation
HDFC Bank Limited
Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation as adjusted for impairment, if any. Cost
includes cost of purchase and all expenditure like site
preparation, installation costs and professional fees
incurred on the asset before it is ready to use. Subsequent
expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised only
when it increases the future benefit / functioning capability
from / of such assets.
Depreciation is charged over the estimated useful life of
the fixed asset on a straight-line basis. The management
believes that the useful life of assets assessed by the
Bank, pursuant to Part C of Schedule II to the Companies
Act, 2013, taking into account changes in environment,
changes in technology, the utility and efficacy of the asset
in use, fairly reflects its estimate of useful lives of the fixed
assets. The estimated useful lives of key fixed assets are
