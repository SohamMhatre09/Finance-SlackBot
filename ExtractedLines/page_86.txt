HR Tech
This year saw the Bank's HR tech
transformation journey took a decisive
turn, with most of the HR services
made available on mobile. The
interventions were designed to amplify
a 'DIY' approach through new-age
interfaces, in line with the digital
vision of the Bank. 'I-Cube', an HR
conversational bot, was introduced
to enable self-service and easy
resolution of queries, not just for active
employees but also for our former
employees. Time Management piece
was brought on mobile devices for
all HDFC banks working in offshore
locations. Many changes related to
process governance, reporting, user
friendliness were incorporated in
the areas of hiring, employee on-
boarding and learning. Other hygiene
HR services were also brought on
the device and network environment
agnostic HCM solution.
Talent management
We have a structured, well-
documented Leadership Competency
Framework. as well as a Functional
Capability Framework which defines
key competencies and forms the
bedrock for various talent processes in
the Bank.
We have also institutionalised the
process of Talent Review Councils,
wherein a panel of leaders take an in-
depth understanding of the Talent from
multiple data points - self view from
employee (mobility, career aspiration
etc.), performance track record, Line
Manager's feedback on the talent
and inputs of potential from the
Development Center Report. This as
a process, is covered for CX & 3 levels
down of their leadership hierarchy.
The year also saw the launch of a
360-degree feedback at apex levels of
leadership. The intervention covering
Group Heads, Business Heads and
senior leaders reporting to the Group
Heads was launched with credible
external partners and facilitated the
gathering of honest feedback by those
who experience the leaders at work
every day. This helped creating better
self-awareness for the leadership
team.
Succession Planning in the Bank
is a continuous process that aligns
with the other talent management
interventions and endeavours to
mitigate critical people risks such as
vacancy fulfilment, and transition risk.
The process of development involves
relevant role exposures, specific
mentoring or coaching exposures and
any specific learning need identified
for employees, to assume higher
responsibilities when the need arises.
We have a comprehensive, bi-annual
performance management system
(PMS) in place. Every employee is
required to make a self-assessment
and or her own performance (bi-
annual basis) based on the key result
areas of his roles and responsibilities.
The Appraiser and Appraisee have a
joint performance discussion based
on the self-evaluation filled by the
Appraisee. In FY22, the PMS was
brought on mobile with pleasant and
easy design, facilitating qualitative
and quantitative dialogue between
the supervisor and the supervised. It
seamlessly encompassed elements of
competence and Bank values in the
process.
Talent: acquisition and attrition
Including frontline sales staff, we hired
57,200 employees. When compared to
the hiring of FY21, the increase stands
at 166%. In order to meet the growing
requirements to outperform the market
in identification, digital evaluation and
quick onboarding of the best talent,
we aim to implement the Applicant
Tracking System in FY23.
