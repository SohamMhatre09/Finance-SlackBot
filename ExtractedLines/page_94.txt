Social - Community
Building resilient
communities together
Social & Relationship Capital
We believe businesses can only thrive if
the communities in which they operate
thrive as well. Our CSR programmes are
designed to have a long-term, meaningful
impact on the upliftment of marginalised
communities, while contributing to global
sustainable development goals. The
pandemic-induced economic hardships
that our communities have witnessed over
the past two years have reaffirmed our
resolve to address deep-seated social
inequalities. We have aligned our efforts
towards a 'people-centric' recovery
through multi-dimensional interventions
across livelihood, skill development,
education, health, and natural resources.
We seek to bring about a revolution in the
quality of life and livelihood of our communities
through our CSR Brand, Parivartan, which
means Change. Our programmes are created
and shortlisted through a participatory, bottom-
up, and consultative process, including all
stakeholders. We work with a variety of NGOs
and partners, as well as employee volunteers,
to assist us in the implementation of various
sustainable development programmes.
