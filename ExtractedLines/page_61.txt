Notes:
Scope 1 emissions includes CO2, N2O and CH2 emissions from the combustion of diesel purchased
by the Bank for its various facilities, as well as combustion of various fossil fuels in Bank-owned
vehicles. For the former, diesel purchase data is extracted from the Bank's financial management
system and the cost of diesel purchased is converted into liters of diesel using conservative
estimates of diesel prices in various states. For the latter source, activity data in terms of quantity
of fuel has been extracted from the financial management system. Emission factors and GWP from
GHG Protocol's Cross sector tool and IPCC's AR5 respectively have been used.
Scope 2 emissions include GHG emissions from electricity consumed in the facilities that can be
reasonably considered to be under the operational control of the Bank, as well as its co-located data
centres. A hierarchical approach has been followed for estimation of emissions from this category
(i.e. (i) monitored data on electrical energy consumption, (ii) estimates of electricity consumed based
on procurement costs and state-level tariff; and (iii) estimated electricity consumption based on
climatic-zone specific, internally derived electricity consumption benchmarks; in that order). In all
cases, Grid emission factor from version 17 of the CEA's (Central Electrical Authority) CO2 database
has been used.
Scope 3 emission estimation: Emission on account of purchased electricity at our other locations
have been estimated using the same approach as in Scope 2 but includes other facilities not
included in Scope 2 emissions. Emissions from hired cabs have been estimated based on expense
report for hired cabs from the Bank's financial management system - which has been used to derive
the distance travelled. Average of emission factor for various categories of cars from the India GHG
programme has been used. For domestic air and rail travel, information on trip characteristics has
been extracted from the Bank's financial management system, and the distance travelled is derived
from publicly available sources. The emissions have been calculated in accordance with the India
GHG programme. For international travel through air, the source of data remains the same, but
emission factors for different class of travel and haul categories have been derived from the GHG
protocol.
Emissions from paper and e-waste have been estimated based on emission factors provided by
the latest version of the USEPA's WARM tool on the extracted data for paper used and e-waste
disposed.
