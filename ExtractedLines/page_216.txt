Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With reference to financial statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject
to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Bank has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and
such internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2022, based on
the internal control with reference to financial statements criteria established by the Bank considering the essential components of
internal control stated in the Guidance Note.
