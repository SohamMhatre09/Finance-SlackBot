Governance
Board initiatives and
involvement
The Board provides leadership and
strategic guidance in shaping our
procedures and processes for value
creation. The key focus areas in FY22
included adherence to regulatory
compliance, creating a strong
technological backbone to mitigate IT
and operational risks, infrastructure
scalability, talent management and
ESG commitments.
Culture of transparency and
accountability
We strive to inculcate global best
practices in governance, timely
disclosures and fair presentation
of information. Transparency and
accountability are among the key
expectations of stakeholders. We have
put in place policies and processes
that allow for a sufficient and visible
flow of information with adequate
safeguards in place. We have also
formulated a Code of Practices and
Procedures for Fair Disclosures in
accordance with the SEBI (Prohibition
of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015.
This Code lays down principles of
prompt disclosure along with uniform
and universal dissemination of
information. Further, the Board has
also approved the following policies
which are available on our website:

· Policy on Appointment and Fit and
Proper criteria for Directors
· Whistle Blower Policy

Policies and frameworks for
ethical conduct
To ensure a pervasive culture of
ethical behaviour, we have created an
environment and instituted policies
and frameworks that encourage
appropriate business conduct. These
policies are communicated regularly to
the management, employees and other
stakeholders.
Our corporate governance policies
include:
· Code of Ethics/Conduct
· Policies to prevent insider trading,
govern related-party transactions
· Policies around Prevention of Sexual
Harassment (POSH)
· Environmental Social & Governance
(ESG) Policy Framework
Transparency and accountability
are embedded in our culture. Our
Code of Ethics/Conduct directs the
Board and senior management to
uphold our values and carry out
business worldwide with integrity
and highest ethical standards. As
per our Conduct Philosophy, we
do not employ child, forced or
compulsory labour in our operations.
Our Whistle-blower Policy provides
a comprehensive framework for
capturing and addressing stakeholder
complaints/grievances. In FY22, we
had 147 whistle-blower complaints
filed by various stakeholders including
shareholders, employees, customers
and value chain partners. The nature
of complaints varied; while some were
linked to corruption and improper
business practices, others pertained to
behavioural issues. We did not make
any political contributions.
Our publicly available Conduct
Philosophy codifies mechanisms to
deal with issues related to mental or
physical coercion or verbal abuse,
sexual harassment, sexual abuse,
slavery, of employees. During
FY22, there were no complaints of
infringement of human rights.
We have a 'Zero Tolerance' policy on
sexual harassment and an internal
complaints committee is in place to
address such complaints. During
the year, we received 51 complaints
pertaining to sexual harassment,
of which 48 were resolved during
the year. For more information, please
