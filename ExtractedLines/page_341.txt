· The Bank has not acquired any Special Mention Account.
· The RBI Master Direction on Transfer of Loan Exposures dated September 24, 2021 has mandated disclosure of
transfer of loan assets. Considering the terms 'loans not in default' and 'special mention account' under this circular
vis-a-vis loans termed as 'standard' as hitherto and the separate processes prescribed therein for transfer of such
assets, the Bank believes that such disclosure would be more meaningful if disclosed prospectively and therefore
transfer of loan exposures prior to September 24, 2021 including comparatives of previous year are not considered
relevant for disclosure.
