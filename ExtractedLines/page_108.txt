Nation Building
Developing our children,
our future
The Bank recognises the importance
of today's youth in shaping the future
of the nation. Accordingly, it works at
many levels to support the country's
education system.
HDFC Bank has been a key player in
extending the reach of Government
schemes that help school children.
It has enabled state education
departments to disburse funds to
Government schools for fulfiling the
nutritional needs under the Mid-Day
Meal Scheme. The Bank has also
helped disburse funds to the last mile
under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyaan
Scheme, a Centrally Sponsored
Scheme focused on making quality
education available to students.

Further, the Bank has enhanced its
education loan offering to students to
enable larger numbers to avail quality
education programmes. This has been
achieved by removing the cap on
loan values and widening the range of
courses for which they can be used.
Additionally, the Bank has worked
with Education Boards to digitise
the payment of remuneration to
faculty who offer their services during
examinations. This has expedited
the pace of these payments, brought
transparency to the process,
and ultimately resulted in higher
participation rates by faculty members
to conduct examinations seamlessly.
Online submission of claims has also
helped the boards and faculties of
these institutions overcome logistical
challenges posed by the pandemic
in submitting and processing such
claims.
The Bank also recognises the critical
role played by educators and has been
committed to improving their lives.
A new initiative under the banner of
#SalaamDilSey was launched this year
for Teacher's Day. Industry leaders
from across the HDFC Group and
others spoke at a special webinar
aimed at helping teachers simplify
their family finances. Attended by
1,300+ teachers, the webinar was
well-received and will now become an
annual affair given its success.
