A different perspective -
Persons with Disabilities at our
workplace
We are focused on building a
workplace wherein every individual has
an opportunity to do meaningful work,
irrespective of any disabilities.
We are taking small but steady steps in
this direction:
Â· Sensitising our people to create an
environment of inclusion for Persons
with Disabilities (PwD). Initiated by our
Board of Directors and Group Heads
in May 2021, sensitisation workshops
that dealt with unconscious biases
were organised for 6,900+ managers
across the organisation.
. The inclusion governance teams work
in tandem with HR to codify roles for
integrating PwD seamlessly within the
organisation. Teams are consciously
working to improve the infrastructure
requirements for fair and free access
and identifying specific barriers for
inclusion of PwDs.
We are in the process of augmenting
our internal systems for better
interconnection for persons with
disabilities. Currently, we have about
115 persons with disabilities employed
with us and have additional hires in the
pipeline. Furthermore, a programme
for enabling the certification of team
leaders on building and managing
inclusive teams is being initiated in
FY23.
Learning and Development
Learning initiatives
In FY22, we brought in a paradigm
shift in our approach to learning
and development through the
establishment of the Learning Partner
model. This model institutionalises
performance consulting, which
consists of identifying a business need,
its cause(s) and the capability building
strategy (if applicable) that can meet
that need. Performance consultants
are experts in understanding business
and improving human performance,
and specialise in enhancing
employees' performance through a
collaborative approach.
The intent is to align business
priorities with learning goals. Further,
we strengthened our offerings
on Leadership and Professional
Development journeys.
'Ignite', a programme aimed at middle
management levels, focuses on
collaborative and strategic skills and
encourages courageous leadership.
'Trailblaze' delivers key competencies
and management essentials for
frontline managers to enhance their
effectiveness.
Building on the foundation laid last
year, we are progressing towards
creating a Virtual University and
Learning Experience platform (LXP).
Targeting the next generation of
employees, LXP facilitates self-paced,
learner-led modules on the go in a
virtual setting.
