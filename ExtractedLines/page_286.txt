Introduction to
HDFC Bank
Overview
improve the banking sector's ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus
reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy.
The Liquidity Risk Management of the Bank is governed by the Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy approved by the Board.
The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision making unit responsible for implementing the liquidity and interest rate risk
management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and ensures adherence to the risk tolerance /
limits set by the Board. In order to determine cash outflows, the Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments,
viz. Retail (which include deposits from individuals), Small Business Customers (those with deposits upto ₹ 7.5 crore), and
Wholesale (which would cover all residual deposits). Within Wholesale, deposits that are attributable to clearing, custody, and
cash management services are classified as Operational Deposits. Other contractual funding, including a portion of other
liabilities which are expected to run down in a 30 day time frame are included in the cash outflows. These classifications, based
on extant regulatory guidelines, are part of the Bank's LCR framework, and are also submitted to the RBI.
The LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank's stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30 day stress period. The
guidelines for LCR were effective January 1, 2015, with the minimum requirement at 60% which have risen in equal annual
steps to reach 100% on January 1, 2019. This graduated approach was designed to ensure that the LCR could be introduced
without material disruption to the orderly strengthening of banking systems or the ongoing financing of economic activity. The
present requirement, as on March 31, 2022 is 100%.
In the Indian context, the run-off factors for the stressed scenarios are prescribed by the RBI, for various categories of liabilities
(viz., deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), undrawn commitments, derivative-related exposures, and
offset with inflows emanating from assets maturing within the same time period. Given below is a table of run-off factors and
the average LCR maintained by the Bank quarter-wise over the past two years:
