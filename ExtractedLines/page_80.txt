At HDFC Bank, our culture and people
are key enablers to continue creating
value for our stakeholders. We have
embarked on a conscious Culture
Transformation journey i.e. "The HDFC
Bank Way". It is a key element of the
3Cs: Culture, Conscience and Customers
that empower our business. The HDFC
Bank Way is defined by the six pillars of
Culture - Integrity, Execution, Innovation,
Humility, Inclusion and Collaboration.
With the DNA of a responsible banker, we
are aligning our businesses objectives
with the 3Cs of culture, conscience and
customers.
Further, we brought in a paradigm shift in our approach
towards learning and development through the
establishment of the Learning Partner model. We moved
ahead on our Diversity and Inclusion agenda with specific
focus on women and persons with disabilities. Our flagship
initiative, 'HDFC Bank Cares' is designed to enable people
to take charge of their own wellbeing thereby creating
an emotionally committed workforce. We are leveraging
technology in the entire employee journey from talent
onboarding, virtual learning, wellness initiatives, diversity
and inclusion programmes to employee performance
management.
