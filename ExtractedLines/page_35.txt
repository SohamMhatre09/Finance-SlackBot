Financial Statements
The Government of India has unlocked
a large revenue pool by allowing private
sector banks to participate across all
areas of Government business. We are
a leading bank in managing Government
fund flows, with ~26% of total flows routed
through the Bank. The single nodal agency
construct introduced in September 2021
by GOI will further augment these flows.
We are leveraging our extensive reach,
intuitive technological solutions, our
deep network, and sustainable livelihood
initiatives to maximise this opportunity.
We facilitate digitisation of agricultural
procurements, e-governance for
tendering and auction, amongst others,
and offer a differentiated and seamless
experience for Government bodies. In
FY22, the Bank was recognised as one of
the top 5 Banks in the country processing
pay-outs, including direct benefit transfer
under the single nodal agency construct
by the Ministry of Finance to enable this.
The Bank has facilitated and/or developed
the necessary technological solutions to
provide customers with a high quality user
experience.
Our comprehensive digital suite also
acts as a catalyst driving growth in the
institutional business. We have adopted
an ecosystem-based approach to harness
the growing opportunities in educational
institutions, religious institutions, and
housing societies. We enable collections
of society payments, donations, fees, as
well as manage payments to vendors,
employees, etc. We have also forged
partnerships with tech players to adopt
an API-based approach to cater to the
needs of this segment.
Parallelly, we are making continuous
investments to expand our distribution
network in the deep geographies of the
country. Rapid adoption of technology
coupled with deep penetration of mobile
and internet provides fertile ground to tap
into opportunities, by digitally connecting
the last mile. Till date we have on-boarded
4 Lakh+ Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLE)
as Business Facilitators and Business
Correspondents to help source business
for us. With the help of the VLEs, we have
been able to create a large distribution
network to capture the opportunities
in the semi-urban and rural areas. Our
octopus model of distribution puts existing
branches at the core, supported by
agents empanelled through marquee tie-
ups and partnerships. These agents are
capacitated by the Bank through digital
infrastructure, branding and visibility
to function as a mini branch. Digitally-
assisted and unassisted journeys are in
play, with a combination of fintech and
APIs that deliver a seamless experience
securely. These alternate channels not
only create value for the Bank but also
have a larger societal impact supporting
nation-building and the Government's
financial inclusion agenda.
