Achieve carbon neutrality by 2032
In June 2021, the Bank pledged to become carbon neutral
by FY32. We are in the process of rolling out an integrated
actionable strategy roadmap comprising three mitigation
pillars and three management pillars. The next decade
will be a 'Decade of Action' for the Bank, as we will build
on each of these pillars to make meaningful and system-
driven changes within the organisation to achieve our
carbon neutrality goal.
