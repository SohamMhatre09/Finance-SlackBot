Promotion of Education
To convert 2500
traditional schools
to smart schools
To support meritorious
underprivileged students
with scholarships.
Our
targets
To achieve 70%
children at class
appropriate
learning levels in all
intervention schools
We are implementing a programme
to promote education in line with
India's Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan. Under
this theme, we provide multi-faceted
support to schools, to enhance the
quality of education - which includes
training the teachers, providing
scholarships and career guidance
to students, as well as infrastructure
support to schools, such as building
toilets and improving classrooms.
We have dedicated programmes for
improving teachers' skills and scaling
up no-cost solutions for improving
existing systems and processes.
We have also been working towards
establishing libraries, scientific labs
and digital classrooms.
Under this theme, we have set the goal
of enhancing the quality of education in
government schools through a three-
dimensional, target-driven approach.
The first dimension aims to convert
2,500 traditional schools into smart
schools, to establish a favourable
learning environment and enable
teachers to utilise various efficient
teaching-learning methods. We have
identified six building blocks for the
development of smart schools and
would be providing targeted support,
based on a detailed need assessment
and situational analysis of the
availability of adequate infrastructure
such as space and electricity.
The second dimension aims to support
meritorious yet underprivileged
students with scholarships, to not
let the financial crises interrupt the
development of bright young minds.
We identify economically backward
students with an annual family income
below â‚¹2.5 Lakh and a minimum of
55% marks on their latest available
marksheet.
The third dimension targets quality
of education in schools. We aim to
achieve 70% of students in all schools
(those under intervention) at class
appropriate learning (CAL) levels. The
CAL levels are assessed as per the
NCERT defined framework in classes
3, 5, and 8 through the National
Achievement Survey in language,
mathematics, EVS, science, and social
science.

Digital classrooms
The Smart Classrooms by Parivartan
in the state-run schools are equipped
with a pre-loaded projector and
an interactive board. The in-built
e-content is aligned with the
concerned state curriculum, making
learning fun and engaging for the
students. For effective implementation
of the digital classrooms initiative,
the Bank provides training to the
teachers making them the experts and
custodians of the infrastructure.
