A &B As per the salary review approval process of the Reserve Bank of
India, the salary increment proposal to be effected from April 01 in a
given financial year can only be made in the subsequent financial year
post assessment of performance for the reference financial year. For
e.g. salary increment proposal to be made to the RBI effective April
01, 2020 can only be made post assessment of performance for the
financial year 2020 - 2021. The approval received from the RBI will
