Independent Auditor's Report
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial
Statements
The Bank's Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated financial statements in term
of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance
and consolidated cash flows of the Group in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the
Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act, the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and circulars, guidelines and
directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time (the "RBI Guidelines") as applicable to the Bank. The respective
Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in
accordance with the provisions of the Act and the RBI Guidelines for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and
detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls,
that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and
presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Board
of Directors of the Bank, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group are
responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entity to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate
the respective entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the entities included in the Group are responsible for overseeing the respective entity's financial
reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing
("SAs") will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken
on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout
the audit. We also:
路 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control.
路 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Bank
has internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of
such controls.
路 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures
made by Management.
路 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are
