To complement our ESG and Climate
Change risk assessment framework,
we are tailoring our own corporate
loan portfolio towards climate-
sensitive financing and to companies
with robust systems and processes.
For this purpose, we have begun
engaging with select customers to
understand their current ESG strategy,
compliance, reporting frameworks
and ESG ratings; their operations, and
long-term climate transition plans for
carbon footprint reduction through
process improvements in existing
operations, business transitions, such
as de-commissioning of certain lines
of business and investment in 'clean'
technologies; and targets for water
consumption reduction, emission
reduction, etc.
The Product Responsibility sub-
committee of our ESG action
committee focuses on identifying new
opportunities in the Environmental and
Social space, such as Green Bonds.
We aim to provide access to capital for
environmentally sustainable projects
that contribute to climate change
mitigation.
We also finance renewable energy
projects. So far, we have underwritten
loans of ₹14,839 Crore for a cumulative
capacity of 5,860 MW (solar capacity
of 3,386 MW and wind of 584 MW).
We have also financed city-gas
distribution networks under Minimum
Work Program with a total underwritten
amount of ₹2,393 Crore for 794 CNG
stations and over 4.6 Million domestic
connections. In FY22, we also
partnered with Indore Clean Energy
Private Limited for financing Asia's
largest waste to energy plant at Indore,
Madhya Pradesh. This plant aims
to treat 50% of municipal waste
generated in the city and convert it
to 100% biogas and manure.
