Stakeholder Engagement
Understanding
stakeholder
expectations
At HDFC Bank, we engage with our
stakeholders to understand and
respond to their expectations and
concerns. This provides valuable
insights that help us shape our
priorities and strategy. We have a
well-defined process to identify and
prioritise our major stakeholders,
based on their involvement with
and value to the organisation.
Customers
Through our 6,342 branches and 18,130 ATMs/
CDMs, we serve over 7.1 Crore customers.
Further, we are enhancing our disability-inclusive
infrastructure and services. All our ATMs are
equipped with a voice-guided system and a Braille
keypad for the visually challenged. We are also
increasingly setting them up in locations with ramps
to enable access to wheelchair-bound customers.
At present, 850 of our locations, including branches
and ATMs, are equipped with ramps. We assess all
our premises and install ramps wherever feasible.
