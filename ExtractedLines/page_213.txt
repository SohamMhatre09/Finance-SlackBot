Independent Auditor's Report
We communicate with Those Charged with Governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit
and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide Those Charged with Governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with Those Charged with Governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance
in the audit of the standalone financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2022 and are therefore the key audit
matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter
or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the
adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
