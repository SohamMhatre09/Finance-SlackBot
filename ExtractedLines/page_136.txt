Wholesale Banking
The Wholesale Banking business was a key growth engine for
your Bank in the year under review. This business focuses on
institutional customers such as the Government, PSUs, large and
emerging corporates, and SMEs. Your Bank's strong offerings
include working capital and term loans, as well as trade credit,
cash management, supply chain financing, foreign exchange,
and investment banking services.
The Wholesale Banking business recorded healthy growth,
ending FY 2021-22 with a domestic loan book size of â‚¹ 737,896
crore, recording a growth of 26.4 per cent over the year earlier.
This constituted about 55 per cent of your Bank's domestic
loans as per Basel II classification. Your Bank was able to
expand its share of the customer wallet, primarily using sharper
customisation, cross-selling and expanding into greater
geographies. And continuing to lend during the pandemic while
being prudent.
Corporate Banking, which focuses on large, well-rated
companies, continued to be the biggest contributor to Wholesale
Banking in terms of asset size. It was able to do so as it was
armed with sufficient cash due to its strong capital base and
balance sheet.
In Corporate banking, your Bank refocused on its engagement
with MNCs. This business also continued to capitalise on the
trend of large companies preferring to deal with fewer banks.
Your Bank deepened its existing relationships as well as
gained market share by leveraging its wide product offering.
This business supported customer requirements under
the Production Linked Incentive Scheme. The Emerging
Corporates Group, which focuses on the mid- market segment,
too witnessed significant growth. Your Bank leveraged its
vast geographical reach, technology backbone, automated
processes, suite of financial products and quick turnaround
times to offer a differentiated service, which has resulted in new
customer acquisitions as well as a higher share of the wallet from
existing customers. The business continues to have a diversified
portfolio in terms of both industry and geography.
In the year under review, the Bank continued its focus on the
MSME sector. There has already been increased formalistion/
digitalisation of the MSME sector due to the adoption of the
Goods and Service Tax (GST). The COVID-19 pandemic led to
the sector experiencing substantial stress, prompting the Union
Government to identify it for special support through various
schemes like Moratorium, ECLGS, ECLGS Extension and COVID
support loans. Your Bank supported its customers during this
period by participating in the Government schemes.
The Investment Banking business further cemented its
prominent position in the Debt Capital Markets, Equity Capital
Markets and INR Loan Syndication. Your Bank maintained its
position amongst the top 3 in the Bloomberg rankings of Rupee
Bond Book Runners for FY 2021-22, with a market share of
14.42 per cent. Your Bank is actively assisting clients in equity
fund raising and was ranked 5th in the PRIME Database League
Tables for IPOs and Rights Issues for FY 2021-22 for private
sector issues against 9th for FY 2020-21. Your Bank is ranked
2nd in the Bloomberg rankings of Syndicated INR term loans
for FY 2021-22, with a market share of 11.32 per cent against
ranking of 3rd for FY 2020-21.
In the Government business, your Bank sustained its focus on tax
collections, collecting direct tax (CBDT) of Rs 4,08,869.61 crore
and Indirect tax (CBIC+ GST) of over Rs 2,24,712.76 crore during
FY 2021-22. It continues to enjoy a pre-eminent position among
the country's major stock and commodity exchanges in both
Cash Management Services and Cash Settlement Services.

Services to its wholesale banking customers. It was an early
