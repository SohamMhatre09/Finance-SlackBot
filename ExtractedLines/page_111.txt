Introduction to
HDFC Bank
Overview
CSC now includes 4 Lakh+ centres
across India for banking services. Of
this, more than 68% are in semi-urban
and rural areas. We also have 15,000+
centres enabled across India for
conducting banking transactions.
Social Security Schemes:
17,500+ enrolled
for SSL schemes
across APY, JBY & SBY
EMIs collected: 62,000+
transactions across Retail
and SLI/JLG loans
The approach in deeper geographies
is based on the ecosystem around
the distribution network, our
digital capabilities and rule-based
underwriting to provide seamless
service. In the process of training our
VLEs, which includes women, we
equip them with digital skills and make
them self-reliant by enabling them to
function as a small branch. To scale
further into deeper geographies by
replicating our success with CSC, we
have also signed MOUs with additional
partners. We are driven by the
aspiration to provide banking products
and services to the vast unbanked and
underserved sections of the society.
Women empowerment is furthered
by training 1.3 Lakh+ women from
19,600+ SHGs, making them
financially self-reliant and positively
impacting the lives of more than 6
Lakh fellow countrymen in semi urban
and rural areas. Under the Stree
Swabhiman initiative, sanitary napkin
making units have been provided
to women VLEs, to manufacture
economic and hygienic pads. These
are provided to 12,500 school-going
girls who have been adopted for a year
by the Bank, thereby creating an eco-
system of menstrual hygiene access.
10 Lakh citizens in the
hinterlands were able to
register for their COVID-19
vaccinations at CSCs
with the Bank's support.
Registration costs for
all 10 Lakh citizens was
funded by the Bank.
Driving digitisation in Rural
Banking
We have integrated 30+ APIs which
power the digital delivery of 25+
best-in-class financial products and
services to the last mile customer.
We have also funded the digital
infrastructure set-up for 4,000 villages
supporting the Digi Gaon initiative of
the Government.
