Our target includes GHG emissions
generated by our operations arising
from the combustion of fossil fuels
(Scope 1 emissions) as well as
emissions from the generation of
purchased electricity consumed by
the Bank (Scope 2 emissions) at its
operating locations and its owned
and co-located data centres. The
target covers carbon dioxide (CO2),
nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane
(CH4) emissions.
Our integrated strategy for achieving
carbon neutrality is based on a
detailed assessment of our key
operational parameters. The baseline
emissions were established based on
the latest dataset available, which fed
into an integrated tool for forecasting
emissions. The projected emissions
based on a likely business growth
scenario were laid over with multiple
scenarios of emission reduction
pathways to understand cost and
potential reductions under each
scenario. Based on an engaging and
deeply consultative process with our
departmental teams and ESG action
committees, we have set our eyes to
achieve carbon neutrality based on
the following interventions:
Demand-side energy
management
We are in the process of adopting
a broad range of technological
solutions and operational measures
to reduce energy consumption at our
operating locations. We have mapped
Energy Performance Indicator (EPI)
for all our locations and are using
it as an internal benchmark for the
energy performance of all types of
facilities. We have shortlisted various
demand-side interventions for
phase-wise implementation across
locations based on an assessment of
feasibility and RoI. These measures
include smart IoT-based building
management systems, modular
UPS systems, air-conditioners with
high ISEER rating using Brushless DC
Motors (BLDC) technology, etc.
Supply-side energy
interventions
We seek to progressively decarbonise
our energy consumption and
are increasingly adopting low-
carbon energy sources to support
our operations. Our supply-side
strategy focuses on gradual shifting
to green tariffs offered by utilities
wherever available and procurement
of renewable energy from offsite
power plants and exchanges. The
green tariff option, which is currently
available only in a few states
(Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra
Pradesh) is expected to be made
available and affordable in more
states, and therefore in the interest
of sustainability, we plan to make use
of the offering on a gradual basis,
despite a premium over the existing
electricity rates. In large locations
where regulatory requirements for
open access and wheeling are met,
renewable energy will be procured
from offsite power plants, either
directly or through power exchanges.
The initial list of locations where
renewable energy procurement is
planned to be taken up is already
identified. A firm-level policy guideline
on making maximum use of green
energy supply interventions in existing
and new locations is also being
finalised. If and when required, we may
also utilise green certificates for carbon
neutrality compliance.
Carbon Credits and
Offsets
Carbon offsets will continue to play
a role in addressing the balance
of our residual emissions. We will
evaluate and leverage carbon
offsets and assess opportunities to
develop mitigation and abatement
projects through technological and
nature-based solutions. We intend
to engage in voluntary markets, and
in compliance markets when the
latter is applicable to our business
operations. When participating in
voluntary carbon markets, we will
carry out due diligence to ensure that
we retire the highest quality offsets,
which are verified by internationally
recognised standards such as Verra,
Gold Standard, etc., to balance our
residual emissions. We will adopt a
two-pronged approach to secure the
availability of offsets for retirement.
While we may make direct investments
in carbon offset generating projects
in collaboration with our partners, we
may also need to purchase carbon
credits from various market options on
a need basis for retirement against our
residual emissions. While investing in
carbon offset generating projects, we
will prioritise projects that add socio-
economic-ecological value to the
communities in which we operate, and
those projects which are in proximity to
our operations in India.
The 'management' related pillars of
our carbon neutrality strategy pertain
to developing firm-level guidelines
for operations and procurement
for supply-side and demand-side
interventions, establishing a framework
for coordinated action between
key teams for implementation and
continuously enhancing the GHG
data collection processes to improve
the quality of the inventory. We will
also monitor the implementation of
interventions and progress towards
our emission reduction targets every
two years and realign our integrated
strategy incorporating the best
available technologies and measures.
