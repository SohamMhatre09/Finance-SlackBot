Helping the Government
digitise fund distribution
efficiently
The bank plays a major role in
distribution of the Government's funds
for most major schemes like central
sponsored schemes, central sector
schemes and funds from the 15th
Finance Commission.
The Bank is one of the top 5 banks
processing Government pay-outs
including Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)
and has also been recognised by the
Ministries of Finance, Panchayati Raj and

Powering trade and digital
commerce
The Bank's integration with various
platforms demonstrates continued
contribution to the Government's 'Ease
of doing business' and 'Digital India'
initiatives. The Bank has integrated with
the following platforms:
· 'ICEGATE' (Indian Customs and
Central Excise Electronic Commerce/
Electronic Data Interchange Gateway)
· National Agriculture Markets (eNAM)
· FOIS system (Freight Operations
Information System) of Indian
Railways
The Bank's long association with GeM
portal, which facilitates procurement
for Government departments, was
extended as it was empanelled to
collect GeM Caution Money for
registered suppliers.
The Bank has enabled about hundred
thousand suppliers to be eligible
to transact on the Government
e-Marketplace by offering them the
facility to deposit caution money that
suppliers must deposit with GeM, prior
to becoming active on the platform.
Improving our foreign ties
HDFC Bank has created dedicated
products for Embassies, Consulates
and diplomats, helping strengthen
the nation's foreign ties. To address
the pain-points of this segment, the
Bank offers best-in-class solutions
including seamless international Trade
and Forex facilities, digital solutions for
Visa collections and special current
accounts to suit the needs of the
expatriate community.

State Governments and incubators/
