Vulnerability management
The Bank administrates a vulnerability
management process that actively
scans for security threats. The
vulnerability management team
is responsible for tracking and
following up on vulnerabilities. Once a
vulnerability requiring remediation has
been identified, it is logged, prioritised
according to severity, and assigned an
owner. The vulnerability management
team tracks such issues and follows
up frequently until they can verify that
the issues have been remediated.
Patch management
The Bank has patch management
processes and tools to assess
and deploy operating system and
application specific patches and
updates. This process includes steps
to evaluate vendor supplied patches to
determine servers that require patches
and updates, to document procedures
for patching and updating servers,
and to deploy patches and updates in
a timely manner to protect the Bank's
infrastructure.
Penetration testing
To test for potential vulnerabilities,
penetration tests are conducted for all
critical networks and systems within
the Bank's internal environment and
for external applications. Penetration
tests are triggered based on several
events, including new releases,
updates, or enhancements. The types
of penetration tests that are conducted
include Network/Host Penetration
Testing and Application Penetration
Testing.
Logging and monitoring
The Bank has a logging and monitoring
procedure in place to deal with
network intrusions and incidents. User
actions, system activity and changes
to the infrastructure are logged. Logs
are stored securely and are protected
against modification, deletion, and
inappropriate access. The relative
risk level of the asset and alerts are
generated in the event of audit log
failures. Monitoring tools aggregate the
log files and suspicious activity events
are automatically reported to the SOC
(Security Operations Centre) team.
The SOC team performs the following
steps:
· Analysis and Incident Detection -
The SOC team collects information
from the system generated event as
well as other information sources to
identify a potential incident
· Event Tracking and Escalation -
Events are assessed based on the
level of risk and escalated based
on guidance from the Incident
Management policy; escalations
include referral to the CIRT for in-
depth analysis and forensics and
management for situation awareness
· Reporting - The CSOC team
periodically reports on events and
incidents to management
