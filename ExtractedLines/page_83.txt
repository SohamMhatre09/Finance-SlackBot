Our D&I agenda focuses on two critical
segments:
· Gender diversity
· Persons with Disabilities (PwD)
Women at our
Workplace
We work relentlessly to support the
women at our workplace and provide
them with an ecosystem that nurture
their careers while being mindful of
their unique challenges. Today, 21.7%
of our workforce consists of women
and we have set a target to increase
this to 25% by 2025.
'Family reasons' was revealed as a
top driver for women attrition in our
attrition studies. We also understood
that returning mothers were finding it
difficult to balance work and personal
responsibilities. To this effect, we have
undertaken focused interventions and
designed programmes that address
these challenges.
Bank Again Program: This
programme enables women to re-start
their careers after a break. We reached
out to over 3,000 women employees
who had left from the bank over the
past 5 years, out of which over 300
former colleagues have re-joined the
Bank. We are also closely monitoring
our gender hiring with 28% of those
hired in the year being women. This
excludes front-line sales hiring.
'Pleasant Parenthood Program:
Under this programme, we have a suite
of offerings and initiatives to support
women along their critical milestones
- pre, during and post maternity leave.
This programme also enables flexibility
with respect to work timings, location
and provides part-time working
options. All our full-time employees
are entitled to avail parental leave. In
FY 22, 1182 female and 3072 male
employees availed parental leave of
which 99.75% female (1179) and 100%
male (3071) returned to work. 6.6%
women (78) and 5% men (160) who
returned to work after leave ended,
were still employed with us after 12
months.
