Nation Building
Contributing to
India's development
HDFC Bank continued its journey
to contribute to nation-building
by digitising payments, collecting
direct, indirect, and local taxes,
and facilitating digital commerce by
integrating with various Government
owned platforms like e-National
Agricultural Marketplace, and
Government e-marketplace and
offering banking solutions to
unbanked and underserved sections
of the society. The focus is to ensure
the unbanked sections of the society
are provided relevant financing
and other banking services. As a
responsible banker, we aim to deliver
relevant banking solutions through
partnerships with Government and
other entities. The goal is to enable
easier availability of funds and
facilitate ease of doing business
for beneficiaries such as farmers,
students, teachers, and healthcare
workers, amongst others.
As a socially responsible citizen, HDFC Bank
endeavours to contribute to nation-building
by remaining focused on key areas. These
include digitising workflows and helping
build alternate channels for the Government,
supporting the start-up ecosystem to help
fuel the economy further and supporting the
Government's financial inclusion agenda.
