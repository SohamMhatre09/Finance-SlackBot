Strategy in Action
People capability
Our people are the face of the Bank.
Our aim is to strengthen our teams
to better understand the 'Voice of
Customer' to enable us to create
newer propositions, simpler processes
and seamless customer experiences.
We have equipped our teams with AI
and analytics-driven pinpointed regular
customer level analysis to enable
enhanced engagement. Further, we
continue to train our teams through
interactive learning interventions that
equip them to enhance customer
delight in all their interactions. The
learning interventions are customised
based on analytics.
Virtual Relationship
Management
As a future-ready Bank, we have
further strengthened our Virtual
Relationship Management (VRM)
channel to enhance customer
engagement and provide seamless
customer service experience. A
banking experience with digital
ease and personalised need based
conversations, is at the core of our
VRM strategy. The Virtual Relationship
Management practice is an integrated
customer-centric approach consisting
of three pillars:
· Virtual Relationship
· Virtual Sales
· Virtual Care
The Virtual Relationship Managers
serve the customer life cycle across -
a) Save b) Invest c) Borrow d) Transact
e) Engage. We believe that we have a
head start with our Virtual Relationship
Management practice, leveraging an
Omnichannel Engagement framework,
seamless digital journeys, data
science-led customer interactions
and a robust talent pool of well-
trained Virtual Relationship Managers.
Your Bank has made significant
investments in technology upgradation
of the customer facing solutions
around Interactive Voice Response
Systems, Data Management and
digital engagement platforms like
Video KYC, to offer a world-class
virtual engagement framework
for its customers. Our systems
are structured, secure, compliant,
automated and avoid any data
leakages. Our VRM framework
provides seamless 24/7 access to
customers and experiences, in line
with global service standards.
We provide automated interactive voice
response solution in 12 languages with
20+ services. We offer world-class
service interaction, with an analytics-
led need-based product distribution
approach, aimed at making us the
preferred banker of choice for the
customer.
Our Virtual Care approach is an
extension of our customer-centric
programme - 'Infinite Smiles' and
we aim for customer satisfaction in
every interaction. We have progressed
further on our conscious journey
of a culture transformation, which
is enshrined along with the critical
leadership tenets of 'Nurture, Care and
Collaborate'. This has also contributed
to better complaints management and
reduced customer wait time.
