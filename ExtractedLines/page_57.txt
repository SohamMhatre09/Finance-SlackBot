Introduction to
HDFC Bank
Overview
Governance
Our Board-governed environmental policy serves
as a framework to understand and manage our
environmental risks, impacts and opportunities.
Our Board of Directors sets courses and evaluates
our performance on social and environmental
responsibility. We are continuously working to
incorporate environmentally responsible practices
in our own operations, through our vendors, as well
as through responsible financing. No cases of non-
compliance with environmental laws and regulations
were identified during the year. We track our GHG
emissions and transparently report our environmental
performance annually.
Metrics and targets
We monitor KPIs for all major environmental
indicators and initiatives covering energy, GHG
emissions, water and waste for all our operations and
aim to minimise the environmental impact thereof.
We report on climate-related disclosures through the
Carbon Disclosure Project and our TCFD disclosures,
which are included in this report. Towards this end,
the Bank is formalising a roadmap to guide its journey
towards carbon neutrality. The roadmap consists of
phased emission and energy reduction targets. More
details on this can be found in subsequent chapters.

Notes:
#Base year for targets for energy and emissions: FY22.
*'Carbon Neutral' targets include the use of offsets and reflect
neutrality over projected emissions in the corresponding year.
** Including both demand & supply measures
Our Scope 1 emissions includes emissions from fuel consumption
in own vehicles and DG sets. Scope 2 emissions include emissions
due to purchased electricity.
Energy consumption as discussed in this report includes energy
consumed by the Bank within its operations - including electricity,
and fuel consumed in DG sets at locations where it has operational
control as well as its co-located data centres and company vehicles.
All targets are based on accelerated emission reduction scenario
used in our integrated carbon neutrality roadmap.
