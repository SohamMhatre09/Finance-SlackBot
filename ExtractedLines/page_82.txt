Diversity and Inclusion (D&I)
Inclusion is one of the key culture
pillars of The HDFC Bank Way.
We promote a work culture where
everyone feels included, respected
and valued, and has access
to equal opportunity. We have
branded our inclusion agenda as
'Valuing Differences'. We provide
equal and fair remuneration
opportunities, irrespective of
gender. No complaints related to
incidents of discrimination reported
during FY22.
