Key initiatives undertaken
Infrastructure scalability
We have invested in a hybrid-cloud
approach with leading cloud service
partners such as AWS, Azure and
GCP. A common landing zone has
been implemented across these
partners to create a secure and
streamlined environment for all cloud
deployments. We have moved our
primary data centers to state-of-the-
art facilities in Mumbai and Bengaluru
to ensure a robust IT infrastructure to
back our digital offerings and ensure
higher uptimes across customer
touchpoints.
Capacity upgrades
Capacity management practices
have been significantly strengthened
to ensure close monitoring of peak
volumes across key performance
parameters. We have established a
Technology Obsolescence Program
Management Office to track, manage
and replace/upgrade obsolete
components in a timely manner.
Disaster recovery resilience
We are moving to the next level
of Disaster Recovery (DR) with
automation and implementation of
'Hot DR'/Active - active setup for key
applications.
Minimised surface area for
cyber-attacks
We have made significant
advancements to further consolidate
cyber security through initiatives
such as the foundation of a next-gen
Security Operations Center (SOC)
for predictive security and incident
management, introduction of SOAR
(Security Orchestration, Automation &
Response) to reduce incident response
times, network micro-segmentation
for better control, visibility and
preparedness against ransomware,
and round-the-clock defacement
monitoring and vulnerability
management of our internet properties.
Looking ahead
We are now fully geared to launch
our next phase of strategic digital
& technology programs. Significant
inroads are being made through
initiatives such as Customer
Experience Hub, a revamped
Payments and Wallet experience
and refreshed offerings for
MSME and Wealth Management
customers.
