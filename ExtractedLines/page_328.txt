Statutory Reports and
Financial Statements
Provisions are determined based on management estimate
required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet date,
supplemented by experience of similar transactions. These
are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and adjusted to
reflect the current management estimates.
A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is:
· a possible obligation arising from a past event, the
existence of which will be confirmed by the occurrence
or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future
events not within the control of the Group; or
· a present obligation arising from a past event which is
not recognised as it is not probable that an outflow of
resources will be required to settle the obligation or a
reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot
be made.
When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation
in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is
remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
Contingent assets, if any, are not recognised in the financial
statements since this may result in the recognition of
income that may never be realised.
