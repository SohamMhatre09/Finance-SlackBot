Digital innovation in
financial services
The pandemic has brought about a
shift in digital technology adoption,
opening up many opportunities in
the financial sector. Digital lending is
one such opportunity, where many
platforms have emerged to offer
hassle-free loans to retail individuals,
small traders and other borrowers.
Many large multinational corporations
whose primary business is technology
(e-commerce, social media, payments
enablers, etc.), popularly known as
BigTechs, have started lending either
directly or in partnership with regulated
financial entities.
~6,000
FINTECH PLAYERS OFFERING SERVICES ACROSS
INVESTMENTS, INSURANCE, PAYMENTS, LENDING
AND BANKING INFRASTRUCTURE
Further, the Indian fintech market is
slated to grow significantly due to
large unpenetrated geographies and
rapid digitisation of the economy. With
~6,000 fintech players, the services
offered are spread across investment,
insurance, payments, lending,
and banking infrastructure. With
cutting-edge technology and niche
target markets, these fintechs offer
customised and user-friendly services
that appeal to the growing tech-
savvy customer base. The regulatory
environment is providing the necessary
impetus with initiatives such as the
e-RUPI, a person and purpose-specific
digital payment solution launched in
August 2021. In the Union budget of
2022-23, India has announced plans
for a Central Bank Digital Currency
(CBDC). Additionally, open banking
trends and a spurt in the number of
off-the-shelf APIs available for banks
and third-party apps to build upon is
changing the dynamics of financial
services industry.
Our response
We are focusing on building new
competencies under Digital Factory,
Enterprise Factory and Enterprise IT.
We are fully geared up to launch the
next phase of our strategic initiatives to
provide seamless customer journeys. We
are continuously innovating to provide
differentiated customer offerings. Through
digitisation we are offering solutions
to enable ease of business across our
diverse customer base. We are focusing
on end to end digital journeys with
omni channel touchpoints designed
around the needs of our customers. We
launched 'Xpress Car Loans' - our new
car loan journey for existing customers
as well as non-customers, resulting in
loan initiation to disbursal in less than
30 mins. We are fostering innovation
with strategic partnerships with multiple
cutting edge startups, Fintechs and
BigTechs to increase the breadth of such
holistic offerings. Benefits such as an
enhanced digital customer experience,
more intuitive user interfaces and neo
tech stacks are pivotal enablers in our
partnership journeys. This has recently
been demonstrated through the roll out
of our Smart Hub Vyapar offering for
merchant ecosystems and our revamped
Customer Experience Hub, an AI/ML
Powered Omni Customer Experience
Transformation program. Our core
technology transformation program is
continually strengthened with new age
technology advancements being built into
our roadmap including our Cloudification,
API, Automation and App modernization
journeys.
