Festive webinars
To add some excitement in the festivals
during the pandemic, we conducted
different webinars/DIY workshops for
employees during popular festivals like
Ganesh Chaturthi, Navratri, Diwali and
Christmas. These workshops were
also focused on involving employees'
children. Activities such as creating an
Eco Ganesha, storytelling around the
history of the festival, and interesting
games centred around such stories,
were conducted as a part of these
workshops.

Million dollar challenge
In 2020, we introduced this interactive
online team building game which
became very popular among
employees. Last year was the second
season of this challenge. This game
served as a very effective icebreaker
for new joiners. We also leveraged the
game to build camaraderie in cross-
functional teams.
