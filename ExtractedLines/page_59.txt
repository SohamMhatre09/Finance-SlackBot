Overview
Enhancements to our emissions boundary and scope
Enhancing the boundary
of Scope 2 emissions
Co-located data centres included in the boundary for Scope 2 emissions
Ensuring completeness
of Scope 2 emissions
boundary
Captive and Offsite ATMs (previously excluded due to non-availability
of monitored activity data) are now included on the basis of emission
estimation methodologies
Realignment of Scope
categories for diesel use
emissions in gensets
Emissions on account of diesel consumption in diesel generator sets are now
accounted for under Scope 1, instead of Scope 2
Enhancing the boundary
of Scope 3 emissions
We are now including facilities other than those owned & operated by the
Bank as a separate category in our scope 3 emissions
As a result of the enhanced boundary and scope, our total
GHG emissions for FY22 increased 11% y-o-y by 36,100
tCO2e, of which 92% (33,136 tCO2e) is attributed to the
addition of a new source category. Another
12,728 tCO2e was added to the inventory on account of
electricity consumption from our co-located data centres.
Thus, overall, there is a net reduction in GHG emissions in
FY22 considering only the sources that were included in
FY21 reporting. As a result, the share of Scope 1 and Scope
3 in our total emissions profile increased to 6% and 12%,
respectively. Scope 2 emissions maintained 82% share in
our total emissions.
