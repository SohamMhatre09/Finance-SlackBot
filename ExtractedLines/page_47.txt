Risk Governance
Our Board of Directors is responsible
for managing comprehensive
risks. The Risk Policy & Monitoring
Committee (RPMC), constituted by the
Board, oversees the implementation
of our risk strategy. The RPMC guides
the development of our policies,
procedures and systems and evaluates
their adequacy and appropriateness to
the changing business conditions, as
well as our risk appetite.
The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) heads the
independent Risk Management Group
(RMG). The CRO interacts regularly
with the members of the RPMC.
The RMG is primarily responsible
for implementing the risk strategy
approved by the Board, and
developing policies, procedures and
systems for identifying, measuring,
monitoring, assessing and managing
risks.
Risk frameworks and their
implementation
The nature of our business and
business activities, along with the
regulatory environment and external
environment at large, exposes us
to several types of risks. For us, the
keys risks are credit risk, market risk,
liquidity risk, operational risk, cyber
security and data risk. Our operations
expose us to compliance and
reputation risk. We are also exposed
to ESG risks. We have put in place an
aggregate risk appetite framework. In
addition, the appetites for individual
risk types are operationalised through
risk-specific policies, limits and
triggers.
We also have a structured
management framework in the Internal
Capital Adequacy Assessment
Process (ICAAP) to identify, assess
and manage all risks that may have
a material adverse impact on our
business/financial position/capital
adequacy.
Risk exposures are regularly captured
and reported to the relevant levels
of management for initiation of
appropriate mitigation measures. We
also continuously evaluate the efficacy
of existing risk model assumptions and
parameters and refine the models to
keep up with the changing times.
We have an Internal Audit Department
which is responsible for independently
evaluating the adequacy and
effectiveness of all internal controls,
risk management, governance systems
and processes.
We have separated the Risk, Audit
and Compliance functions from the
Business functions to create a strong
culture of checks and balances and
to eliminate any possible conflict of
interest between revenue generation,
and risk management and control.
Key risk management
initiatives
Evolving stress testing scenarios
In addition to the existing suite of
standard stress scenarios, we are
conducting stress testing based on
topical themes driven by prevailing
trends such as geopolitical/
macroeconomic/sectoral, among
others. These stress tests are
conducted focusing on specific areas
of portfolio and the results act as
early warning alerts/signals for taking
actions, if any. Some of the topical
themes relevant for the present times
include the evolving geopolitical turmoil
in Europe due to the Russia-Ukraine
conflict, commodity price shocks, and
possible shift in key macroeconomic
variables in the medium term.
Russia-Ukraine conflict
We analysed both direct and indirect
impact of the conflict on our portfolio.
The situation remains fluid globally, and
there is uncertainty regarding the final
outcome from a geopolitical as well as
a financial market standpoint. Stress
testing of our portfolio considering the
current information did not indicate any
significant risk. We continue to closely
monitor the situation, to pre-empt and
manage the risk and its outcomes.
Sri Lanka's sovereign default
With continuous and robust monitoring
of country risk exposures and stress
testing, we have proactively taken
steps to limit our exposure to Sri
Lanka. Although the impact of the
default is unlikely to be material for the
Bank, we are keeping a close eye on
the situation.
Increasing focus on non-
financial risks
We believe a lot more can be done
in the area of researching, analysing,
monitoring and mitigating non-
financial risks such as operational,
technology and reputation, among
others. Accordingly, we are elevating
deliberations of non-financial risks
in the RPMC/Board. We are also in
the process of enhancing policies,
procedures and risk assessment
framework for such non-financial risks.
Leveraging technology
In line with our technology
transformation agenda, we are also
automating our risk management
processes. We believe it will increase
efficiencies, enhance accuracy of
information, and enable maintenance
of adequate audit trail for reviews.
