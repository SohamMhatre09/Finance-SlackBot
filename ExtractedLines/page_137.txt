Treasury
The Treasury is the custodian of your Bank's cash/liquid assets
and handles its investments in securities, foreign exchange
and cash instruments. It manages the liquidity and interest rate
risks on the balance sheet and is also responsible for meeting
reserve requirements. The vertical also helps manage the
treasury needs of customers and earns a fee income generated
from transactions customers undertake with your Bank while
managing their foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
Revenue accrues from spreads on customer transactions based
on trade and remittance flows and demonstrated hedging needs.
Your Bank recorded revenue of â‚¹ 3,907.9 crore from foreign
exchange and derivative transactions in the year under review.
While plain vanilla forex products were in demand across all
customer segments, demand for derivatives products increased
with the RBI liberalizing regulations and allowing Indian banks to
participate in Non-Deliverable Offshore markets.
As part of its prudent risk management, your Bank enters into
foreign exchange and derivatives deals with counterparties after
it has set up appropriate credit limits based on its evaluation of
the ability of the counterparty to meet its obligations. Where
your Bank enters into foreign currency derivatives contracts
not involving the Indian Rupee with its customers, it typically
lays them off in the inter-bank market on a matched basis. For
such foreign currency derivatives, your Bank primarily carries
the counterparty credit risk (where the customer has crystallised
payables or mark-to-market losses) and may carry only residual
market risk, if any. Your Bank also deals in derivatives on its own
account, including for the purpose of its own Balance Sheet
risk management.
Your Bank maintains a portfolio of Government Securities in
line with the regulatory norms governing the Statutory Liquidity
Ratio (SLR). A significant portion of these SLR securities are in
'Held-to- Maturity' (HTM) category, while some are 'Available for
Sale' (AFS). Your Bank is also a primary dealer for Government
Securities. As a part of this business, your Bank holds fixed
income securities as 'Held for Trading' (HFT).
In the year under review, your Bank continued to be a significant
participant in the domestic exchange and interest rate markets. It
also capitalised on falling bond yields to book profits and is now
looking at tapping opportunities arising out of the liberalisation
in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets.
B) International Business
During the year, your Bank stayed on course to cater to NRI
clients and deepen its product and service proposition. Your
Bank has global footprints by way of representative offices and
branches in countries like Bahrain, Hong Kong, the UAE and
Kenya. It also has a presence in International Financial Service
Centre (IFSC) at GIFT City in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.
The Bank's product strategy in International Markets is customer
centric and it has products to cater to client needs across asset
classes. Your Bank now has plans to extend the product offering
from GIFT City Branch under Liberalized Remittance Scheme to
Resident and Non Resident clients.
As on March 31, 2022, the Balance Sheet size of International
Business was US$ 7.66 billion. Advances constituted 3.12% of
