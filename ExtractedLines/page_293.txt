transition to IND-AS, based on the updated regulations and accounting standards / guidance and business strategy at the
date of actual transition, could differ from those reported in the fit for consolidation information.
40. COVID-19
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had led to a nation-wide lockdown in April-May 2020. This was followed by localised
lockdowns in areas with a significant number of COVID-19 cases. Following the easing of lockdown measures, there was an
improvement in economic activity in the second half of fiscal 2021. Since then India experienced two waves of the COVID-19
pandemic following the discovery of mutant coronavirus variants, leading to the reimposition of regional lockdowns which
were subsequently lifted.
The impact of COVID-19, including changes in customer behaviour and pandemic fears, as well as restrictions on business
and individual activities, led to significant volatility in global and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease in global and
local economic activities. The disruptions following the outbreak, impacted loan originations, the sale of third party products,
the use of credit and debit cards by customers and the efficiency in collection efforts resulting in increase in customer defaults
and consequent increase in provisions there against.
India is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which any new wave of COVID-19 will impact the Bank's results
will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, including, among other things, any new information concerning the
severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any action to contain its spread or mitigate its impact whether government mandated
or elected by us.
