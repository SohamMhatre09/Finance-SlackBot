Risk Management
Robust and stress-
tested framework
Our robust Risk Management framework and the independence of
our risk management function set us apart as a responsible banker.
It enables the execution of our strategic priorities without taking on
undue financial and non-financial risks. Our risk policies and processes
and their effective implementation through technology and governance
enabled us to endure and even grow in these highly uncertain and
disruptive times. Stress testing is one of the key risk management tools
we use to mitigate and manage the existing as well as emerging risks.
