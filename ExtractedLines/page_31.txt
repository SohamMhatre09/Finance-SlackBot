empowering the most disadvantaged sections of the society around our area of operations, to be self-
reliant. The Board-level CSR & ESG Committee oversees the initiatives and tracks progress on a regular
basis. To secure the nation's growth and development, as well as the well-being of its residents, we have
aligned our actions with government missions and programmes.

climate change
GRI aspects: Emissions
Capitals impacted:
We recognise our role in the transition to a low-carbon economy. At HDFC Bank, we have been
recording our GHG emissions and will continue to track and report our carbon footprint. Recently, we
pledged to become carbon neutral by FY32. We continue to scale up the use of renewable energy and
energy management measures at our operations.
Climate change may have a substantial impact on our activities, and thus, we have initiated steps
towards the implementation of TCFD recommendations.
