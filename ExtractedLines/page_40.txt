Wealth
Wealth is one of the key focus areas
for the Bank. We are focused on the
Affluent and Mass Affluent segment
of customers to drive growth. A
large proportion of wealth in India is
distributed even beyond the top 20
cities of the country. The Bank aims to
increase the Wealth Relationship team
and expand its reach in B30 (beyond
top 30) cities, to tap into this segment
through a hub and spoke model.
The Bank's Wealth team is currently
serving customers across 216 cities
and is on track to reach 800+ locations
by the end of this financial year. We are
also investing in our people through
intensive training to develop the right
knowledge capital and service skillsets
to provide consistent quality of service
across these locations.
Our dedicated service team for Wealth
Clients ensures delivery of our 'Service
First' philosophy. The bank has
adopted Annual Recurring Revenue
(ARR) as a key metric to ensure
transition from transactional approach
to portfolio management approach
and minimise churn. We have an open
architecture for insurance where we
have multiple partners across life,
health, and general insurance to offer
the right product to the right customer.
Our non-proprietary framework across
investment products which makes
recommendations based on robust
quantitative and qualitative evaluation
model, re-accentuate our customer
centricity.
We are developing a mobile-first
Wealth Platform that will leverage
advanced analytics and AI-driven
recommendations to provide
differentiated wealth solutions across
all customer segments. The digital
platform will focus on agile, unassisted
journeys and mass personalisation
to cater to customers across the
country. The goal is to deliver a
highly personalised experience that
democratises wealth management
and makes it accessible for all our
customers.
