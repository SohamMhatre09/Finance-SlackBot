Governance
The DNA of a
responsible banker
Our governance framework forms
the bedrock of our value creation
process. At HDFC Bank, stringent
regulatory compliance is a given.
Beyond compliance, our practices
aim to embody the principles of
ethical conduct, independence,
responsibility, accountability, and
transparency in true spirit. This is
reflected in our strategic thinking,
decision-making, monitoring
processes and underlines all our
activities and operations.
We are led by a diverse, experienced and
competent Board. The Board, along with its
committees, institutes policies and frameworks
on ethical conduct, anti-corruption, anti-money
laundering, compliance, IT, information security,
ESG, and customer satisfaction, among
others, and monitors their implementation. We
strive to adhere to best practices in corporate
governance, such as alignment of executive
pay to company performance, disclosure of
Board evaluation outcomes, and wide scope of
whistle-blower policy, to name a few.
