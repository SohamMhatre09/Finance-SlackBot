Materiality Assessment
Prioritising issues that matter
We conducted a materiality
assessment exercise, in
accordance with GRI standards, in
FY19 to identify the most important
topics that could significantly
impact our value creation. Inputs
gathered from key stakeholders
were factored into our strategy
planning. Taking a step further in
FY21, we modified our materiality
study to align our ESG strategy
with business goals, by including
emerging topics such as climate
change risks and opportunities.
