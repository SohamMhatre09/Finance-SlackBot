Rural Development (Natural Resource Management)
Our Holistic Rural Development
Programme (HRDP) focuses on
comprehensive development through
activities under NRM, Education,
Skill Development and Livelihood,
Financial Literacy and Healthcare.
These activities are based on the
belief that rural development is key to
India's growth. The Natural Resource
Management theme rests on the
twin goals of enhancement of natural
resources and their optimal utilisation
for the economic development of the
community. Under this theme, we
have defined three goals. First, we
are working to irrigate 2 Lakh acres
of unirrigated land and cover 1 Lakh
acres with vegetation, to increase the
area of land under cultivation, as well
as to increase the cropping intensity of
cultivable land.
