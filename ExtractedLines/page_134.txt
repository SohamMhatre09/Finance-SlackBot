Business Review
Your Bank's operations are split into Domestic and International.
A) Domestic Business comprises the following:
Retail Banking
The Retail Business operated under challenging circumstances
in the year under review but these were less pronounced
compared with the previous year. This business is directly
linked to consumption, which slowed down in general during
the lockdown. The lockdown was less severe in the year under
review and as the unlock gathered momentum, the business
too gained momentum with Domestic Retail Advances rising
by 13.7 per cent.
Domestic Retail Deposits grew by 18.5 per cent to ₹ 1,262,093
crore from ₹ 1,064,684 crore in the preceding year, while
Retail Advances rose 13.7 per cent to ₹ 599,608 crore from
₹ 527,586 crore.
Personal Loans continue to exhibit strong growth with overall
portfolio reaching ₹ 1,40,000 crore at the end of the year.
A greater focus on the Government segment as well as top
corporates resulted in improved portfolio quality.
This year, your Bank maintained leadership position in Auto
Loan segment, which underwent supply chain constraints, by
outpacing industry growth, thus increasing marketshare and
crossing ₹ 100,000 crore.
There is continued focus on digitalising processes and customer
touchpoints to better your Bank's reach. After the great success
of Personal Loan in 10 Seconds, Digital Loan Against Shares
and Digital Loan against Mutual Funds, the Bank has recently
launched an end-to-end digital car loan process (Application
to Disbursement). This is an industry first car loan process with
a completely digital, contactless and paperless experience,
wherein New to the Bank customers can avail disbursement
within 30 Minutes (which includes Video KYC Process) and
existing pre-approved customers can get loan disbursement in
10 seconds.

presence not only acts as a catalyst for cashless transactions
but also spurs consumption. With 4.30 crore debit cards, 1.65
crore credit cards and about 28.94 lakh acceptance points, it
