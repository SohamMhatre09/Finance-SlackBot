The Honourable Supreme Court of India (Hon'ble SC), in a public interest litigation (Gajendra Sharma Vs. Union of
India & Anr), vide an interim order dated September 03, 2020 ("Interim Order"), had directed banks that accounts
which were not declared NPA till August 31, 2020 shall not be declared as NPA till further orders. Accordingly, the
Bank did not classify any account which was not NPA as of August 31, 2020 as per the RBI IRAC norms, as NPA
after August 31, 2020.
The Interim Order granted to not declare accounts as NPA stood vacated on March 23, 2021 vide the judgement of
the Hon'ble SC in the matter of Small Scale Industrial Manufacturers Association vs. UOI & Ors. and other connected
matters. In accordance with the instructions in paragraph 5 of the RBI circular dated April 07, 2021 issued in this
connection, the Bank continued with the asset classification of borrower accounts as per the extant RBI instructions
/ IRAC norms.
· Divergence in the asset classification and provisioning
In terms of the RBI guidelines, banks are required to disclose the divergence in asset classification and provisioning
consequent to RBI's annual supervisory process in their notes to accounts to the financial statements, wherever the
additional provisioning assessed / additional gross NPAs identified by RBI exceeds the threshold specified by RBI. The
threshold for provisioning is 10 per cent of the reported profit before provisions and contingencies for the reference period
and that for additional gross NPAs is 15 per cent of the published incremental Gross NPAs for the reference period.
There was no divergence in asset classification and provisioning for NPAs for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.
