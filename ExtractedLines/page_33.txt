Overview
Re-imagining Retail Branch
Banking
Our growing phygital reimagined
branch channel is pivotal to our
strategic intent of being India's best
customer-centric brand across
industries, within the next three years.
Retail Branch banking is the key
enabler for retail deposits, retail trade
and forex business, unsecured and
secured asset business and third-party
distribution business. We continue to
reimagine our branch channel backed
by micro market focused multiformat
distribution science, phygital
transformation, analytics and Artificial
Intelligence (AI). This is backed by an
institutionalised approach to customer
life cycle management and a 'Service
First culture'.
The levers that bring to life our
reimagining branch channel
strategy are:
Holistic customer life cycle
management
It starts from our ability to map and
source the right set of customers using
a differentiated go-to-market approach
and results in having need-based
conversations and offering the right
product proposition. It also entails
continually nourishing the relationship
through our relationship management
architecture and recommending next
best actions and implementing them.
Our 'service first culture' is embedded
throughout the customer life cycle
management journey.
