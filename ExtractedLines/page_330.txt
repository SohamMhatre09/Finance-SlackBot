Basic earnings per equity share has been computed by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the equity shareholders
by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per equity share has been
computed by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to the equity shareholders by the weighted average number of
equity shares and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding during the year, except where the results are anti-dilutive. The
dilutive impact is on account of stock options granted to employees by the Bank. There is no impact of dilution on the profits
in the current year and previous year.
