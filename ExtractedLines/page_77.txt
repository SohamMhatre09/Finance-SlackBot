Mooh Band Rakho
After the tremendous success of our
Mooh Band Rakho campaign in 2020,
we launched the second edition in
support of the International Fraud
Awareness Week in November 2021.
Aimed at increasing awareness on all
types of financial fraud, the campaign
underlined the importance of not
disclosing information, especially
banking details, and to safeguard
oneself from digital frauds.
We launched a series of videos using
relatable real-life situations to educate
customers on various types of modus
operandi. We conducted over 2,000
workshops over 4 months across
the country, advocating simple steps
such as not clicking on unknown links,
sharing card details, CVV, Expiry Date,
OTP NetBanking/ MobileBanking Login
ID & Password over Phone, SMS,
email and social media. It focused on
the younger segment targeting Senior
Secondary Schools & Colleges to
make safe banking an early habit in
their financial journey.

unlock, the campaign aimed to spread
reasons for joy and cheer. Revolving
around the theme of 'Karo Har Dil
Roshan', the Bank reached out to every
Indian through high impact visibility
via TV, branches, ATMs, partnerships
with stores/websites and digital media
campaigns with a hyper local focus.
