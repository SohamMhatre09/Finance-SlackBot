There is also an employee association
at the Bank. As of FY22, 0.18% of
our permanent employees are part
of this association. The Bank has an
internal Memorandum of Settlements
that may be interpreted as a collective
bargaining agreement, signed
between the Management and Union
office bearers. There are periodic
negotiations with Union Office Bearers
and the Memorandum of Settlement
is signed by the Management to
the extent of their benefits and
service conditions - including any
significant operational changes. We
provide 21 days' notice typically to
employees and their representatives
prior to implementation of significant
operational changes that could
substantially affect them.
Measuring employee
engagement
HDFC Bank continues to be
certified as a Great Place to Work®
Organisation. This certification is
a testimony to the Bank's inherent
strength as an institution par
excellence and the efforts to support
and enable employees through
best-in-class people practices and
processes.
The Bank partners with Great Place
to Work® to conduct their employee
engagement survey over three cycles
(18 months per cycle). Organisations
participating in the survey are
assessed through two lenses - the
Trust Index and the Culture Audit.
Great Place to Work® Institute audits
the company's human resource
practices and policies. On meeting the
qualifying criteria, the organisation is
certified as a Great Place to Work for a
period of one year.
The survey was conducted for a
second time in November 2021. Over
94% of the eligible employees (86,506
employees) participated and scored
the Bank on five key parameters,
namely, camaraderie, fairness,
respect, pride, and credibility, amongst
its employees.
The important distinction that this
score brings is as follows:
Employee connect initiatives
Over the year, we organised several
initiatives that provide employees
an opportunity to connect with the
organisation beyond their work-life.
These initiatives spanned multiple
areas including sports, art, music,
wellness, and photography, ensuring
there is something in it for everyone.
We also focused on involving family
members which was met with
an enthusiastic response. 43,121
employees participated across 21
initiatives during the year. Following is
a brief on some of the key initiatives
