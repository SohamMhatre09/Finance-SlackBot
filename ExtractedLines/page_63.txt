Building management and Green
Buildings: We have incorporated
several changes within our
infrastructure to improve energy
efficiency through auto controls and
environment-friendly equipment. We
have installed centrally controlled
energy management system in
600 branches across India till date.
This system allows us to control
consumption patterns, resulting in
a minimum of 10% saving on power
consumption. In FY22 alone, we
saved ~48.81 Lakh units. Based on
encouraging results from this project,
we plan to expand the initiative to an
additional 1,500 branches across
the country.
We have LEED Gold certified offices in
Mumbai and Bhubaneswar. In addition,
new buildings in Mohali, Kolkata Palava
and Mumbai (Maharashtra) premises
are being constructed to meet IGBC
Gold certification standards. Similarly,
our Wanowrie back-office has
been designed as per IGBC Green
standards; we have received IGBC
Gold rating for it. All new interior work
carried out during and after FY22 are
being designed as per IGBC Green
standards. So far, interior work at
378 branches is being carried out as
per IGBC Green standards and one
branch in Maharashtra has received
Gold rating.
Besides, we are leveraging technology
and innovation as facilitators in our
journey towards low-carbon growth.
We have implemented elevator and
equipment scheduling to reduce our
energy consumption. We have also
installed occupancy sensors, capacitor
banks as well as Building Management
Systems at several of our operating
locations. The energy management
modules with auto controls deployed
across select branches have resulted
in significant energy savings.
