shall therefore be required to deduct tax at source at the time
of payment of dividend. The deduction of tax at source will be
based on the category of shareholders and subject to fulfilment
of conditions as provided herein below:
. For Resident shareholders
Tax will be deducted at source ("TDS") under Section 194 of the
Act @ 10% on the amount of dividend payable unless exempt
under any of the provisions of the Act. However, in case of
resident shareholders, TDS would not apply if the aggregate of
total dividend distributed/paid to them by the company during a
financial year does not exceed ₹ 5,000.
Tax will not be deducted at source in cases where a shareholder
provides Form 15G (applicable to all individuals) / Form 15H
