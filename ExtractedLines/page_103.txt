We have adopted an integrated
approach related to healthcare and
hygiene. We have not only been
provisioning healthcare services
to our communities in the form of
health clinics, nutrition programmes
and immunisation drives, but have
also been working on hygiene
and sanitation in schools and
communities. To complement our
community-led sanitation efforts
directed toward the proper disposal
of wastewater, we have been
working on the institutionalisation
of waste pickers through social and
financial inclusion for dry waste
management.
Under this thematic area, we have set
the goal to improve sanitation facilities
- which we are implementing through
targeted efforts on three distinct sub-
goals. The three sub-goals are related
to waste management, clean drinking
water and household sanitation
facilities.
Under the first sub-goal, we are
developing waste management
systems in 1,000 settlements. We are
committed to establishing a long-term
solid waste management system by
providing the necessary infrastructure
and instilling the necessary behavioural
changes toward responsible
consumption, source segregation and
litter prevention. This includes setting-
up materials recovery facilities (MRF)
and recycling facilities in 15 ULBs, in
addition to village-level interventions
such as residential composting,
door-to-door garbage collection and
the related mechanisms for user
fee collection, compost sales and
recycling.
We are targeting 1,000 communities
for providing access to clean drinking
water. This would include interventions
to promote clean drinking water
availability at both the community-
level (through Jal-minar or other water
23,800+
HOUSEHOLD TOILETS CONSTRUCTED*
1,810+
SANITATION DRIVES CONDUCTED*
buildings) as well as at the family-level
(piped water connection). Through
these interventions, three litres of
water per person per day will be
made available. We are also forming
and orienting water user groups to
ensure sustenance of the services who
would be entrusted with post-project
maintenance and water quality testing.
The third sub-goal pertains to
ensuring that 100% of households
have acceptable sanitation facilities.
While the Government of India is
believed to have provided sanitation
facilities to every household, we are
supplementing the government's
efforts by working towards
enhancing the usage of such facilities
by undertaking soft initiatives
like awareness and motivation,
infrastructure-based interventions, to
support the repair and upgradation of
such facilities, if and where required.
