Global economic growth
set to moderate
The protracted Russia-Ukraine
conflict, Sri Lanka's sovereign default
and structural slowdown in China
are weighing heavily on the global
economic recovery. Inflationary
pressures have increased, as supply
chains remain in disarray and trade
sanctions on Russia push up energy
prices. While Brent crude oil is
hovering above $120/bbl, natural gas
price has risen by more than 50%
since March 2022. In response, many
central banks including the US Federal
Reserve, have tightened their monetary
policy. Against such a backdrop, the
IMF expects global GDP growth to
moderate to 3.6% in 2022 from 6.1%
in 2021. Among advanced economies,
the US is expected to grow at 3.7%
(vs. 5.7% in 2021), while Euro area
growth is estimated to halve from
3.7%
EXPECTED GLOBAL GROWTH IN 2022
5.3% in 2021 and the UK economy is
estimated to grow at 3.7% in 2022 vs.
7.4% in 2021. While Russia is expected
to record a negative output growth,
China is expected to grow at 4.4% vs.
8.1% in 2021.
In India, export growth may see a
moderation post a good performance
last year. Inflation is expected to remain
high due to rising input costs, lingering
supply disruptions and elevated energy
prices. The recent rate hikes by the
RBI may put upward pressure on
interest cost and weigh on investments
and consumption. Additionally, global
liquidity withdrawal presents a risk for
foreign capital flows. In India, GDP
growth is estimated at 7.3% in FY23
vs. 8.7% in FY22, with risks tilted to
the downside. Encouragingly, despite
the slowdown, in FY23, India is likely
to perform better than its Emerging
Market peers. While zero COVID-19
policy and related lock downs are
likely to drag down China's economy,
developing European countries (like
Poland) are likely to suffer due to the
ongoing war.
Our response
We undertake topical stress testing
based on prevailing geopolitical/
macroeconomic/sectoral and other
trends. One such topical stress
analysis was conducted to estimate
the impact - direct and indirect -
of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on
our portfolio. We do not see any
significant risk, based on the current
information available. We, as part of
our continuous and robust country
risk monitoring, have proactively
taken steps to limit our exposure
to Sri Lanka. Nonetheless, we are
closely monitoring the overall situation
both at the global and India level and
are modifying our course of action
accordingly.
Government and
regulatory interventions
During the two waves of COVID-19,
the RBI announced Resolution
Frameworks (RF) 1.0 and 2.0 to
provide relief to borrowers and lending
institutions. While the restructuring
of large borrower accounts under RF
1.0 could be invoked by December
31, 2020 and implemented within 180
days from the date of invocation, they
have time till September 30, 2022 to
achieve the operational parameters.
On the other hand, resolutions under
RF 2.0 for individuals, small businesses
and MSMEs could be invoked before
September 30, 2021 and the resolution
plan had to be implemented within 90
days from the date of invocation.
Our response
MSMEs are considered an important
economic growth engine and are
one of the largest employers in the
country. The Bank's Assets in the
MSMEs segment stood at ₹3,13,919.49
Crore as on March 31, 2022. Its Micro
Enterprises Assets alone stood at
₹1,12,564.77 Crore. We continued
to extend support to our customers
through ECLGS and ECLGS extension
schemes and also provided ad-hoc
enhancements as needed. Your Bank
emerged as a star performer under
the ECLGS 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and ECLGS
extension schemes. We disbursed
loans amounting to ₹17,100.89 Crore
to over 0.78 Lakh customers under
various ECLGS schemes. This swift
