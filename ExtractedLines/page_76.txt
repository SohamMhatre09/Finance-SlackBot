Customer Centricity
Guided by our aspiration to move
from score to systems, we have been
working to institutionalize the process
for addressing customer issues that
transcend beyond measurement and
create a culture of customer-centricity
and agility.
We would not only like to anticipate
and react to changing customer
expectations but also like to provide
a proposition to our customer that
makes us more attractive than
competitive alternatives.
With this in view we subscribed to
competitive benchmarking of NPS, in
form of a subscription based product
NPS Prism®.
HDFC Bank leads the overall brand
NPS ranking among 20+ competitors
in the banking category.
Our commitment to building a
customer obsessed culture and
constant effort to include everyone
in the organisation has ensured
continuous improvement leading to
growth in customer advocacy of the
brand.

Some of our customer-centric initiatives
#SalaamDilSey
On Doctors Day - 2021, we presented
Salaam Dil Sey - a platform for our
customers to thank doctors and their
families for their hard work, sacrifice
and tireless service. As they bravely
continue to fight the pandemic, we
tried to put a smile on their faces.
Customers dedicated a "Salaam
Dil Sey" (a personalized greeting
card) to over 1 lac doctors and their
families. HDFC Bank put all these
greeting cards in a collage, displayed
on 'Wall of dedication' at its Sandoz
Bank House and unveiled on 1st July
2021 virtually by Dr Naresh Trehan
in presence of prominent media and
Bank's Sr. officials. This attempt was
also recorded in Asia Book of Records
& India Book of Records for "Largest
Collage of Thank you messages".
The Bank also gave musical tribute to
the doctor's fraternity by a specially
curated anthem on the Salaam Dil
Sey theme. HDFC Bank reached out
to 23Mn+ people through print, social
media and email/SMS. Our branch
staff personally met and greeted
40,000+ doctors during this campaign.
