Risk Management
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank may not be able
to meet its financial obligations as they fall due, without
incurring unacceptable losses.
Mitigation
The Bank's framework for liquidity and interest rate
risk management is spelled out in our Asset Liability-
Management policy. Further, a robust mechanism to
comprehensively track cash flow mismatches under
normal as well as stressed conditions and critical ratios
including Basel III ratios has also been implemented.
The Bank has an extensive intraday liquidity risk
management framework for monitoring intraday
positions during the day.
Strategies
路 To maintain healthy liquidity as evidenced in Liquidity
Coverage Ratio (LCR)/Net Stability Funding Ratio
(NSFR) in line with our Balance sheet size to tide over
any unforeseen stress scenarios.
