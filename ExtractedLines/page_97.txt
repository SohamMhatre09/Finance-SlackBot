carbon and promote
sustainability
1,000 villages to have clean
and renewable energy
solutions
reducing the carbon and ecological
footprint of our communities
Second, we aim to reduce the
carbon and ecological footprint of
our communities by promoting clean
and renewable energy solutions.
This includes undertaking projects
such as tree plantation for carbon
sequestration and biodiversity
conservation. We are targeting 1,000
villages to have clean and renewable
energy solutions and a minimum of 10
solar lights in each village. In addition,
we are providing solar home lights,
biomass chulha, biogas plant, solar
study lamp, and a solar irrigation unit,
covering 25% of the households in
each village. The biomass stoves have
helped improve indoor air quality,
creating a direct positive impact on
women's health. Further, we target to
plant 2.5 Million trees by FY25.
Third, we have been promoting the use
of chemical-free farming, to maintain
the soil, environment, and human
health by combining tradition, creativity
and science. We train farmers on
different agricultural techniques for
improving productivity and using locally
produced manure and fertilisers, which
not only aid in chemical-free farming
but also help avoid expenditures on
chemical fertilisers.
