growth benchmarks
The hallmark of the Bank's financial
performance has been consistent growth
across all key metrics, which has helped
consolidate its leadership position. Its
Balance Sheet continues to be healthy
and strong which is evident by a growth of
18.4% in the current year.

The endeavour to reach all customers across India has
contributed to an increase in branches to 6,342 as at the
year end. This together with our ability to understand and
fulfil customers' financial needs along with management
of customer relationships has led to an overall increase of
16.8% in Deposits and 20.8% in Advances. The continuous
monitoring of costs and building of operational efficiencies
has resulted in only a marginal increase of 0.60% in the Cost
to Income Ratio to 36.9%.
The asset mix of the Bank has shifted to high rated but low
yielding segments.
Consequently, the Net Interest Margin has reduced
marginally to 4.0%. It is pertinent to note that the change
in asset mix has a positive impact on the net credit margin
which has increased to 3.3% in the current year.
The impact of our effective risk management system along
with robust credit policy and underwriting skills can be seen
in the quality of our assets and low GNPA ratio of 1.17%.
Even with a low GNPA, as a responsible banker, specific
provision coverage has been increased to 72.7% and the
coverage of total provisions comprised of specific, floating,
contingent and general provisions, has been increased to
182% as at the year end.
We continue to deliver double-digit growth both in earnings
and return on equity. The Profit After Tax has grown by
18.8% and return on equity has increased to 16.9%.
