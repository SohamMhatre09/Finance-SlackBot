Our digital marketing strategy is to
create awareness about our brand,
build brand loyalty for our financial
solutions and services through a deep
understanding of customer behaviour
and preferences. Digital marketing
for us entails providing frictionless
customer journeys and addressing
customer requirements with the right
product, at the right time, in their most
preferred channel of communication
and with high levels of personalisation.
One of the key outcomes expected
from this strategy is contribution
to direct business generation. Our
website has seen growth in customer
visits in both tier and non-tier cites
evidencing increase in our reach and
recall.
We are executing our strategy through
our omni-channel presence, advanced
analytics, data science, working in
cross functional teams and through
customer advocacy.
· Omni-channel: We are using our
Omni-channel forte consisting of
website, Net and MobileBanking,
notifications, SMS, Email, WhatsApp
and social media to deliver the
business portfolio objectives. We
are developing segmented and
personalised communication based
on highly advanced AI/ML models.
· Advanced analytics and data
science: Investments in Cloud-
related advanced analytics tools
enable deep understanding of
customer behaviour, and their
preferences to curate personalised
interventions, at scale and to create
relevant customer engagement.
Through technology and digitisation,
we are executing digital marketing
plans at scale and in tandem with
the traditional marketing channels
to provide our customers quick
and easy access to all our financial
solutions. We have revamped our
digital journeys for loans, deposits
and payment solutions which allow
our customers to purchase products
in a few clicks in a frictionless
manner.
· Our investment in advanced analytics
engine 'Spark Beyond' tests millions
of hypotheses and builds multiple
models in minutes with the aim to
understand customer needs, have
meaningful customer interactions and
build customer relationships. 'Spark
Beyond' impacts all channels of the
Bank, bringing higher productivity for
manned channels and increase of
business in unassisted channels.
· PODs: To support end-to-end
outcomes like un-assisted business
generation digitally, we work in multi-
disciplinary and cross-functional
teams called PODs. These PODs
solve business problems through
a lens of data-backed root-cause
analyses and hypotheses.
· Stimulating customer advocacy:
We identify and address grievances
across customer digital journeys and
products to earn customer trust and
create brand advocates using online
reputation management, ratings,
reviews, and testimonials.
