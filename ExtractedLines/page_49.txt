Introduction to
HDFC Bank
Overview
Operational Risk
Operational risk arises from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems or from external events.
It includes risk of loss due to legal risk.
Mitigation
A Board-approved governance structure is in place with
detailed framework and processes for managing operational
risk. Under the framework, the Bank has three lines of
defence namely business line (including support and
operations), An independent Operational Risk Management
Department (ORMD) and Internal Audit to manage, monitor
and mitigate Operational risks.
Strategies
Minimising operational losses through risk mitigation
mechanisms.

Climate Risk
At a broader level, risks from climate change are
typically divided into:
· Physical risks
Economic losses (physical damage to property and
assets) from extreme weather events (flood, cyclone,
etc). due to climate change.
· Transition risks
- The possible process of adjustment to a low carbon
economy and its possible effects on the value of
financial assets and liabilities.
Mitigation
An ESG policy framework has been formulated to
address this risk.
Evaluation of environmental and social risk is an
integral part of our overall credit appraisal and approval
process. Long-term financing proposals for large
industrial/infrastructure projects (greater than ₹100
million and tenor above 5 years) are evaluated through
the SEMS framework, which requires an assessment
of Environmental, Health, Social, and Safety risks
in addition to other risks as part of the overall credit
appraisal process. We also track and externally verify
our carbon emissions to effectively manage and
reduce our footprint.
Strategies
We are exploring frameworks to model and assess
climate risk. We also continue our endeavour to
acquire granular data, further corroborated by BRSR
data (from FY23 onwards), and test tools for climate
risk assessment and conducting scenario analysis. We
are also exploring options to tie-up with data providers.
On the emissions front, we have set ourselves specific
targets towards reduction of our GHG emissions.
