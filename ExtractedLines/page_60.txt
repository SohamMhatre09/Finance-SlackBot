Our Scope 1 emission increased
from 5,826 tCO2e in FY21 to 20,877
tCO2e in FY22, primarily on account
of inclusion of emissions from
diesel consumption in generators -
which were previously included in
Scope 2. This is because we have
actual/ perceived control on the fuel
consumed at a significant number of
our branches and office locations.
Fuel consumption in company-owned
vehicles account for about 41% of
our Scope 1 emissions while diesel
consumption in diesel generators
account for the remaining 59%.
Our Scope 2 emissions decreased by
12,474 tCO2e in FY22 over FY21, of this
9,570 tCO2e was on account of shifting
emissions from diesel generators to
Scope 1. Emissions on account of
purchased electricity decreased by
2,904 tCO2e, despite the inclusion
of our co-located data centres and
an increase in the number of other
locations in Scope 2 inventory.
We are committed to collaborating with
our data centre service providers to
reduce the GHG footprint of our owned
and co-located data centres. Currently,
data centres contribute 7% of our
Scope 2 emissions. This year, we
also enhanced our approach towards
calculation of Scope 2 emissions.
We have stepped up our efforts to
collect actual electricity consumption
data for estimating corresponding
GHG emissions. In doing so, we
are prioritising high-consumption
locations. In FY22, we collected actual
kWh data on electricity consumed
from 46% of our locations - which
collectively consumed about 50% of
electrical energy.
For remaining locations, we track the
cost of electricity consumed through
our robust financial management
system and use the same to derive
estimates of electricity consumed
using the most conservative tariff
for commercial slabs at the state
level. There are some of our smaller
locations like ATMs for which we
are in the process of establishing
systems to collect activity data. For
such locations, we are estimating
electrical energy consumption based
on a methodology that takes into
account the climatic zone in which
such locations are based, and energy
consumption benchmarks derived
from data on actual electrical energy
consumption collected by us in similar
locations. Although electrical energy
consumption at such ATMs is only
about 4% of our total electrical energy
consumption, we are progressively
enhancing our systems to capture
actual activity data on electrical energy
consumption for all locations.
In FY22, our Scope 3 emissions
increased significantly over FY21,
primarily on account of inclusion
of emissions due to electricity
consumption at other facilities.
These emissions now account for
78% of our total Scope 3 emissions.
The remaining 22% of our Scope 3
emissions are split between emissions
due to hired cabs (13%), air and rail
travel (2%), paper waste (7%), and
e-waste (<1%).

We have expanded the
reporting boundary for
our Scope 2 emissions.
This year onwards,
we will be including
emissions relating to use
of purchased electricity
at our co-located data
centres in our Scope 2
emissions.
