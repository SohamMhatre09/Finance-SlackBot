Introduction to
HDFC Bank
Overview
Boosting and protecting
farmer incomes
The Bank has been consistently
assisting the Government focused
sectors such as agriculture and allied
industries.
In line with the Central Government's
focus on developing Farmer Producer
Organisations (FPO), the Bank has
powered the platform created by a
state agriculture department with
integrated digital payment channels.
This has enhanced farmers' access
to a common platform for trading and
buying agri-produce and supplies.
The platform has also helped revenue
optimisation on crop yields by farmers.
The Bank has also helped digitise
the financial operations for the dairy
industry by offering an integrated
solution for the entire ecosystem, thus
driving transparency in the process and
improving planning since it provides
visibility into both the demand and
supply ends of the business.
In the current year, your Bank became
the first private sector Bank to be
empanelled with the Agriculture
Insurance Company of India (AIC), for
marketing their insurance products.
Through this partnership, the Bank aims
to provide financial security and income
stability to farmers, in the event of natural
calamities that affect their crop yield.

Making India healthy
The Bank extended its focus on
healthcare during the pandemic. It
enabled the smooth transfer of funds
from state apex bodies to primary and
secondary healthcare centres and
village level hospitals. Our services
also included digitisation of processes,
expenditure reporting, providing digital
platforms for centralised monitoring of
fund utilisation, etc. The Bank has also
enabled state health departments to
distribute funds in a timely manner to
ASHA Workers as compensation for
extending healthcare services to end
beneficiaries.
The pandemic provided new avenues
for customising banking solutions
across various segments. With
the continued focus on enhancing
affordability, we have enabled several
large partner hospitals/clinics/IVF
centres to provide loans and the ability
to conveniently convert healthcare
treatment costs to EMIs.
These cost-effective solutions will help
customers avail quality healthcare
with ease and flexibility. Our SmartBuy
