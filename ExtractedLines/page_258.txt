Introduction to
HDFC Bank
Overview
From the above, 58 loans aggregating to ₹ 11.45 crore was repurchased by the transferor in compliance with paragraph
48 of Master Direction - RBI (Transfer of Loan Exposures) Directions, 2021.
. The Bank has not acquired any Special Mention Account.
· The RBI Master Direction on Transfer of Loan Exposures dated September 24, 2021 has mandated disclosure of
transfer of loan assets. Considering the terms 'loans not in default' and 'special mention account' under this circular
vis-a-vis loans termed as 'standard' as hitherto and the separate processes prescribed therein for transfer of such
assets, the Bank believes that such disclosure would be more meaningful if disclosed prospectively and therefore
transfer of loan exposures prior to September 24, 2021 including comparatives of previous year are not considered
relevant for disclosure.
. During the years ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, there were no standard assets securitised-out by
the Bank.
. Securitised assets as per books of SPVs sponsored by the Bank
There are no SPVs sponsored by the Bank as at March 31, 2022 and as at March 31, 2021.
· Off-Balance Sheet SPVs
There are no Off-Balance Sheet SPVs sponsored by the Bank, which need to be consolidated as per accounting norms.
