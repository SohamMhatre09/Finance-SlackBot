Building a customer-
centric culture using Net
Promoter System (NPS)
- 'Infinite Smiles'
We, at the Bank, believe that delivering
an outstanding customer experience
is a strong differentiator for a great
product and is key to a sustained
competitive advantage. The primary
aim of the Infinite Smiles programme is
to establish employee behaviour and
practices which leads to customer-
centric actions and continuous
improvements.
Last year, we initiated measurement
on key journeys, identified action areas
to improve customer experience and
implemented several key initiatives.
This has led to a steady improvement
on our NPS over the year. This year,
we built on our commitment to our
customers by scaling the coverage
of our Infinite Smiles program - we
introduced new journeys, new
episodes and new products ensuring a
much wider coverage. Customer focus
has seen an increased focus - regular
cadence with key stakeholders and
rigorous follow-up on actions have
become the cornerstones of
Infinite Smiles.
The programme now encompasses
critical episodes - Digital Journey
Episodes, Credit Card Episodes,
Customer Instructions, Tele
Interactions and Collection Process.
We now cover 120+ episodes and
have contacted around 63 Million
customers in FY22 for their feedback.
Our 'Infinite Smiles' program rests
on three meticulously designed
pillars - 'Listen', 'Learn' and 'Act'
which enables us to embed customer
feedback led transformation as a
discipline into our systems, challenge
what is considered as the standard,
and offer a customer experience
that places us amongst the best
service brands.
